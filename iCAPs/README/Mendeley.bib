abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

@article{McKeown1998,
abstract = {Current analytical techniques applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129–1159). We decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson word/number task, and control tasks into spatially independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component ‘‘map''), and a unique associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived one and only one component with a time course closely matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11–20) were superior to principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements, and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with performance of psychomotor tasks.},

abstract = {Neural activity in the brain is accompanied by changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygenation that are detectable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3) neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) to the neural activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses. Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip), nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses, makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous studies of brain function in development, health, and disease. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As opposed to traditional fMRI signal analysis techniques, we do not impose any prior knowledge of the event timing. Instead, our basic assumption is that the activation pattern is a sequence of short and sparsely distributed stimuli, as is the case in slow event-related fMRI. We introduce new wavelet bases, termed activelets, which sparsify the activity-related BOLD signal. These wavelets mimic the behavior of the differential operator underlying the hemodynamic system. To recover the sparse representation, we deploy a sparse-solution search algorithm. The feasibility of the method is evaluated using both synthetic and experimental fMRI data. The importance of the activelet basis and the non-linear sparse recovery algorithm is demonstrated by comparison against classical B-spline wavelets and linear regularization, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE fMRI is the convolution of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and unmeasured neural activity. HRF variability (HRFv) across the brain could, in principle, alter functional connectivity (FC) estimates from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Given that HRFv is driven by both neural and non-neural factors, it is problematic when it confounds FC. However, this aspect has remained largely unexplored even though FC studies have grown exponentially. We hypothesized that HRFv confounds FC estimates in the brain's default-mode-network. METHODS We tested this hypothesis using both simulations (where the ground truth is known and modulated) as well as rs-fMRI data obtained in a 7T MRI scanner (N = 47, healthy). FC was obtained using 2 pipelines: data with hemodynamic deconvolution (DC) to estimate the HRF and minimize HRFv, and data with no deconvolution (NDC, HRFv-ignored). DC and NDC FC networks were compared, along with regional HRF differences, revealing potential false connectivities that resulted from HRFv. RESULTS We found evidence supporting our hypothesis using both simulations and experimental data. With simulations, we found that HRFv could cause a change of up to 50{\%} in FC. With rs-fMRI, several potential false connectivities attributable to HRFv, with majority connections being between different lobes, were identified. We found a double exponential relationship between the magnitude of HRFv and its impact on FC, with a mean/median error of 30.5/11.5{\%} caused in FC by HRF confounds. CONCLUSION HRFv, if ignored, could cause identification of false FC. FC findings from HRFv-ignored data should be interpreted cautiously. We suggest deconvolution to minimize HRFv.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is increasingly recognized as a disorder of distributed neural dynamics, but the molecular and genetic contributions are poorly understood. Recent work highlights a role for altered N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling and related impairments in the excitation–inhibitory balance and synchrony of large-scale neural networks. Here, we combined a pharmacological intervention with novel techniques from dynamic network neuroscience applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify alterations in the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks related to schizophrenia genetic risk and NMDA receptor hypofunction. We quantified “network flexibility,” a measure of the dynamic reconfiguration of the community structure of time-variant brain networks during working memory performance. Comparing 28 patients with schizophrenia, 37 unaffected first-degree relatives, and 139 healthy controls, we detected significant differences in network flexibility [F(2,196) = 6.541, P= 0.002] in a pattern consistent with the assumed genetic risk load of the groups (highest for patients, intermediate for relatives, and lowest for controls). In an observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over pharmacological challenge study in 37 healthy controls, we further detected a significant increase in network flexibility as a result of NMDA receptor antagonism with 120 mg dextromethorphan [F(1,34) = 5.291, P = 0.028]. Our results identify a potential dy- namic network intermediate phenotype related to the genetic liability for schizophrenia that manifests as altered reconfiguration of brain networks during working memory. The phenotype appears to be influenced by NMDA receptor antagonism, consistent with a critical role for glutamate in the temporal coordination of neural networks and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

How such dynamics and the anatomical patterns of neuronal connectivity are mutually related in brain networks has, however, remained unclear. We addressed this relationship by quantifying the network co-localization of scale-free neuronal activity—neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs)—and functional connectivity (FC) with intra-cranial and non-invasive human resting-state electrophysiological recordings. We first found frequency specific co-localization of scale-free dynamics and FC so that inter-areal coupling of LRTCs and propagation of neuronal avalanches were most pronounced in the predominant pathways of FC.

Across many temporal and spatial scales, network neuroscience has emerged as a central focus of intellectual efforts, seeking meaningful descriptions of brain networks and explanatory sets of network features that underlie circuit function in health and dysfunction in disease. However, the tools of network science commonly deployed provide insight into brain function at a fundamentally descriptive level, often failing to identify (patho-)physiological mechanisms that link system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain function. Here we describe recently developed techniques stemming from advances in complex systems and network science that have the potential to overcome this limitation, thereby contributing mechanistic insights into neuroanatomy, functional dynamics, and pathology. Finally, we build on the Research Domain Criteria framework, highlighting the notion that mental illnesses can be conceptualized as dysfunctions of neural circuitry present across conventional diagnostic boundaries, to sketch how network-based methods can be combined with pharmacological, intermediate phenotype, genetic, and magnetic stimulation studies to probe mechanisms of psychopathology. Braun and colleagues describe a set of new computational tools from multi-dimensional network neuroscience that allow for mechanistic inquiry of neuropsychiatric disorders, and they outline strategies to link levels of brain function, starting from genes to neurotransmitter systems to brain-wide connectivity.},

abstract = {Group independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely applied to studies of multi-subject fMRI data for computing subject specific independent components with correspondence across subjects. However, the independence of subject specific independent components (ICs) derived from group ICA has not been explicitly optimized in existing group ICA methods. In order to preserve independence of ICs at the subject level and simultaneously establish correspondence of ICs across subjects, we present a new framework for obtaining subject specific ICs, which we coined group-information guided ICA (GIG-ICA). In this framework, group information captured by standard ICA on the group level is exploited as guidance to compute individual subject specific ICs using a multi-objective optimization strategy. Specifically, we propose a framework with two stages: at first, group ICs (GICs) are obtained using standard group ICA tools, and then the GICs are used as references in a new one-unit ICA with spatial reference (ICA-R) using a multi-objective optimization solver. Comparison experiments with back-reconstruction (GICA1 and GICA3) and dual regression on simulated and real fMRI data have demonstrated that GIG-ICA is able to obtain subject specific ICs with stronger independence and better spatial correspondence across different subjects in addition to higher spatial and temporal accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the third-largest known genetic risk factor for the development of psychosis. Dysconnectivity has consistently been implicated in the physiopathology of psychosis. Structural covariance of cortical morphology is a method of exploring connectivity among brain regions that to date has not been employed in 22q11DS. Methods: In the present study we employed structural covariance of cortical thickness to explore connectivity alterations in a group of 108 patients with 22q11DS compared with 96 control subjects. We subsequently divided patients into two subgroups of 31 subjects each according to the presence of attenuated psychotic symptoms. FreeSurfer software was used to obtain the mean cortical thickness in 148 brain regions from T1-weighted 3T images. For each population we reconstructed a brain graph using Pearson correlation between the average thickness of each couple of brain regions, which we characterized in terms of mean correlation strength and in terms of network architecture using graph theory. Results: Patients with 22q11DS presented increased mean correlation strength, but there was no difference in global architecture compared with control subjects. However, symptomatic patients presented increased mean correlation strength coupled with increased segregation and decreased integration compared with both control subjects and nonsymptomatic patients. They also presented increased centrality for a cluster of anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal regions. Conclusions: These results confirm the importance of cortical dysconnectivity in the physiopathology of psychosis. Moreover they support the significance of aberrant anterior cingulate connectivity.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional brain imaging studies of network connectivity have long assumed that functional connections are stationary on the timescale of a typical scan. Interest in moving beyond this simplifying assumption has emerged only recently. The great hope is that training the right lens on time-varying properties of whole-brain network connectivity will shed additional light on previously concealed brain activation patterns characteristic of serious neurological or psychiatric disorders. We present evidence that multiple explicitly dynamical properties of time-varying whole-brain network connectivity are strongly associated with schizophrenia, a complex mental illness whose symptomatic presentation can vary enormously across subjects. As with so much brain-imaging research, a central challenge for dynamic network connectivity lies in determining transformations of the data that both reduce its dimensionality and expose features that are strongly predictive of important population characteristics. Our paper introduces an elegant, simple method of reducing and organizing data around which a large constellation of mutually informative and intuitive dynamical analyses can be performed. This framework combines a discrete multidimensional data-driven representation of connectivity space with four core dynamism measures computed from large-scale properties of each subject's trajectory, ie., properties not identifiable with any specific moment in time and therefore reasonable to employ in settings lacking inter-subject time-alignment, such as resting-state functional imaging studies. Our analysis exposes pronounced differences between schizophrenia patients (Nsz = 151) and healthy controls (Nhc = 163). Time-varying whole-brain network connectivity patterns are found to be markedly less dynamically active in schizophrenia patients, an effect that is even more pronounced in patients with high levels of hallucinatory behavior. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration that high-level dynamic properties of whole-brain connectivity, generic enough to be commensurable under many decompositions of time-varying connectivity data, exhibit robust and systematic differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.},

abstract = {Recently, independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely used in the analysis of brain imaging data. An important problem with most ICA algorithms is, however, that they are stochastic; that is, their results may be somewhat different in different runs of the algorithm. Thus, the outputs of a single run of an ICA algorithm should be interpreted with some reserve, and further analysis of the algorithmic reliability of the components is needed. Moreover, as with any statistical method, the results are affected by the random sampling of the data, and some analysis of the statistical significance or reliability should be done as well. Here we present a method for assessing both the algorithmic and statistical reliability of estimated independent components. The method is based on running the ICA algorithm many times with slightly different conditions and visualizing the clustering structure of the obtained components in the signal space. In experiments with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the method was able to show that expected components are reliable; furthermore, it pointed out components whose interpretation was not obvious but whose reliability should incite the experimenter to investigate the underlying technical or physical phenomena. The method is implemented in a software package called Icasso. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2018 Background: Patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) present a high risk of developing psychosis. While clinical and cognitive predictors for the conversion towards a full-blown psychotic disorder are well defined and largely used in practice, neural biomarkers do not yet exist. However, a number of investigations indicated an association between abnormalities in cortical morphology and higher symptoms severities in patients with 22q11DS. Nevertheless, few studies included homogeneous groups of patients differing in their psychotic symptoms profile. Methods: In this study, we included 22 patients meeting the criteria for an ultra-high-risk (UHR) psychotic state and 22 age-, gender- and IQ-matched non-UHR patients. Measures of cortical morphology, including cortical thickness, volume, surface area and gyrification, were compared between the two groups using mass-univariate and multivariate comparisons. Furthermore, the development of these measures was tested in the two groups using a mixed-model approach. Results: Our results showed differences in cortical volume and surface area in UHR patients compared with non-UHR. In particular, we found a positive association between surface area and the rate of change of global functioning, suggesting that higher surface area is predictive of improved functioning with age. We also observed accelerated cortical thinning during adolescence in UHR patients with 22q11DS. Conclusions: These results, although preliminary, suggest that alterations in cortical volume and surface area as well as altered development of cortical thickness may be associated to a greater probability to develop psychosis in 22q11DS.},

abstract = {Clinical staging improved the possibility of intervening during the psychosis prodrome to limit progression of illness. The current study aimed to validate a novel 4-stage severity-based model with a focus on clinical change over time and risk for conversion to psychosis. One hundred seventy-one individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis were followed prospectively (3 ± 1.6 y) as part of the Recognition and Prevention (RAP) program and divided into 4 diagnostic stages according to absence/presence and severity of attenuated positive symptoms. Twenty-two percent of the combined sample recovered (no prodromal symptoms) by study outcome. The negative symptoms only subgroup had the highest symptom stability (70{\%}), but the lowest conversion rate at 5.9{\%}. The subgroup with more severe baseline attenuated positive symptom levels had a higher conversion rate (28{\%}) and a more rapid onset when compared to the moderate attenuated positive symptom subgroup (11{\%}). Finally, the Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis (SLP) subgroup showed low stability (3{\%}), with 49{\%} developing a specific psychotic disorder. The proposed stage model provides a more finely grained classification system than the standard diagnostic approach for prodromal individuals. All 4 stages are in need of early intervention because of low recovery rates. The negative symptom only stage is possibly a separate clinical syndrome, with an increased risk of functional disability. Both subgroups with attenuated positive symptoms are appropriate for studying the mechanisms of psychosis risk, however, individuals with more severe baseline positive symptoms appear better suited to clinical trials. Finally, the SLP category represents an intermediate outcome group appropriate for preventative intervention research but questionable for inclusion in prodromal studies of mechanisms.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity during the resting state has been shown to change over time (i.e., has a dynamic connectivity). However, resting-state fluctuations, in contrast to task-based experiments, are not initiated by an external stimulus. Consequently, a more complicated method needs to be designed to measure the dynamic connectivity. Previous approaches have been based on assump- tions regarding the nature of the underlying dynamic connectivity to compensate for this knowledge gap. The most common assumption is what we refer to as locality assumption.Under a locality assumption, a single connectivity state can be estimated from data that are close in time. This assumption is so natural that it has been either explicitly or implicitly embedded in many cur- rent approaches to capture dynamic connectivity. However, an important drawback of methods using this assumption is they are unable to capture dynamic changes in connectivity beyond the embedded rate while, there has been no evidence that the rate of change in brain connectivity matches the rates enforced by this assumption. In this study, we propose an approach that enables us to capture functional connectivity with arbitrary rates of change, varying from very slow to the theoretically maximum possible rate of change, which is only imposed by the sampling rate of the imaging device. This method allows us to observe unique patterns of connectivity that were not observable with previous approaches. As we explain further, these patterns are also significantly correlated to the age and gender of study subjects, which suggests they are also neurobiologically related.},

However, the extent to which large-scale networks exhibit their own organized temporal dynamics is unclear. We use an approach designed to find repeating network patterns in whole-brain resting fMRI data, where networks are defined as graphs of interacting brain areas. We find that the transitions between networks are nonrandom, with certain networks more likely to occur after others. Further, this nonrandom sequencing is itself hierarchically organized, revealing two distinct sets of networks, or metastates, that the brain has a tendency to cycle within. One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition. Moreover, we find that the proportion of time that a subject spends in each brain network and metastate is a consistent subject-specific measure, is heritable, and shows a significant relationship with cognitive traits.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) has been widely applied to identify intrinsic brain networks from fMRI data. Group ICA computes group-level components from all data and subsequently estimates individual-level components to recapture intersubject variability. However, the best approach to handle artifacts, which may vary widely among subjects, is not yet clear. In this work, we study and compare two ICA approaches for artifacts removal. One approach, recommended in recent work by the Human Connectome Project, first performs ICA on individual subject data to remove artifacts, and then applies a group ICA on the cleaned data from all subjects. We refer to this approach as Individual ICA based artifacts Removal Plus Group ICA (IRPG). A second proposed approach, called Group Information Guided ICA (GIG-ICA), performs ICA on group data, then removes the group-level artifact components, and finally performs subject-specific ICAs using the group-level non-artifact components as spatial references. We used simulations to evaluate the two approaches with respect to the effects of data quality, data quantity, variable number of sources among subjects, and spatially unique artifacts. Resting-state test-retest datasets were also employed to investigate the reliability of functional networks. Results from simulations demonstrate GIG-ICA has greater performance compared with IRPG, even in the case when single-subject artifacts removal is perfect and when individual subjects have spatially unique artifacts. Experiments using test-retest data suggest that GIG-ICA provides more reliable functional networks. Based on high estimation accuracy, ease of implementation, and high reliability of functional networks, we find GIG-ICA to be a promising approach.

abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that data quality is a critical confound in the construction of brain networks derived from functional MRI. This problem is particularly relevant for studies of human brain development where important variables (such as participant age) are correlated with data quality. Nevertheless, the impact of head motion on estimates of structural connectivity derived from diffusion tractography methods remains poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated the impact of in-scanner head motion on structural connectivity using a sample of 949 participants (ages 8-23 years old) who passed a rigorous quality assessment protocol for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Structural brain networks were constructed for each participant using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We hypothesized that subtle variation in head motion would systematically bias estimates of structural connectivity and confound developmental inference, as observed in previous studies of functional connectivity. Even following quality assurance and retrospective correction for head motion, eddy currents, and field distortions, in-scanner head motion significantly impacted the strength of structural connectivity in a consistency- and length-dependent manner. Specifically, increased head motion was associated with reduced estimates of structural connectivity for network edges with high inter-subject consistency, which included both short- and long-range connections. In contrast, motion inflated estimates of structural connectivity for low-consistency network edges that were primarily shorter-range. Finally, we demonstrate that age-related differences in head motion can both inflate and obscure developmental inferences on structural connectivity. Taken together, these data delineate the systematic impact of head motion on structural connectivity, and provide a critical context for identifying motion-related confounds in studies of structural brain network development.},

abstract = {Background The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers a markedly increased risk for schizophrenia. 22q11.2 deletion carriers without manifest psychotic disorder offer the possibility to identify functional abnormalities that precede clinical onset. Since schizophrenia is associated with a reduced cortical gamma response to auditory stimulation at 40 Hz, we hypothesized that the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) may be attenuated in nonpsychotic individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion. Methods Eighteen young nonpsychotic 22q11.2 deletion carriers and a control group of 27 noncarriers with comparable age range (12-25 years) and sex ratio underwent 128-channel EEG. We recorded the cortical ASSR to a 40 Hz train of clicks, given either at a regular inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms or at irregular intervals jittered between 11 and 37 ms. Results Healthy noncarriers expressed a stable ASSR to regular but not in the irregular 40 Hz click stimulation. Both gamma power and inter-trial phase coherence of the ASSR were markedly reduced in the 22q11.2 deletion group. The ability to phase lock cortical gamma activity to regular auditory 40 Hz stimulation correlated with the individual expression of negative symptoms in deletion carriers ($\rho$ = -0.487, P = .041). Conclusions Nonpsychotic 22q11.2 deletion carriers lack efficient phase locking of evoked gamma activity to regular 40 Hz auditory stimulation. This abnormality indicates a dysfunction of fast intracortical oscillatory processing in the gamma-band. Since ASSR was attenuated in nonpsychotic deletion carriers, ASSR deficiency may constitute a premorbid risk marker of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Background 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is one of the strongest known genetic risk factors for developing schizophrenia. Individuals with 22q11.2DS have high rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, while in adulthood ∼25{\%} develop schizophrenia. Similar to the general population, high rates of comorbidity are common in 22q11.2DS. Employing a dimensional approach where psychopathology is examined at the symptom-level as complementary to diagnostic categories in a population at such high genetic risk for schizophrenia can help gain a better understanding of how psychopathology is structured as well as its genetic underpinnings. This is the first study to examine the dimensional structure of a wide spectrum of psychopathology in the context of a homogeneous genetic etiology like 22q11.2DS. Methods We evaluated 331 individuals with 22q11.2DS, mean age (SD) = 16.9(8.7); 51{\%} males, who underwent prospective comprehensive phenotyping. We sought to replicate previous findings by examining a bi-factor model that derives a general factor of psychopathology in addition to more specific dimensions of psychopathology (i.e., internalizing, externalizing and thought disorder). Results Psychopathology in 22q11.2DS was divided into one ‘general psychopathology' factor and four specific dimensions (i.e., ‘anxiety', ‘mood', ‘ADHD' and ‘psychosis'). The ‘psychosis' symptoms loaded strongly on the ‘general psychopathology' factor. Conclusions The similarity of the symptom structure of psychopathology between 22q11.2DS and community and clinical populations without the deletion indicate that 22q11.2DS can provide a model to explore alternative approaches to our current nosology. Our findings add to a growing literature indicating the need to reorganize current diagnostic classification systems.},

abstract = {Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a broad phenotype of clinical, cognitive and psychiatric features. Due to the very high prevalence of schizophrenia (30-40{\%}), the investigation of psychotic symptoms in the syndrome is promising to reveal biomarkers for the development of psychosis, also in the general population. Since schizophrenia is seen as a disorder of the dynamic interactions between brain networks, we here investigated brain dynamics, assessed by the variability of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals, in patients with psychotic symptoms. We included 28 patients with 22q11DS presenting higher positive psychotic symptoms, 29 patients with lower positive psychotic symptoms and 69 healthy controls between 10 and 30. years old. To overcome limitations of mass-univariate approaches, we employed multivariate analysis, namely partial least squares correlation, combined with proper statistical testing, to analyze resting-state BOLD signal variability and its age-relationship in patients with positive psychotic symptoms. Our results revealed a missing positive age-relationship in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in patients with higher positive psychotic symptoms, leading to globally lower variability in the dACC in those patients. Patients without positive psychotic symptoms and healthy controls had the same developmental trajectory in this region. Alterations of brain structure and function in the ACC have been previously reported in 22q11DS and linked to psychotic symptoms. The present results support the implication of this region in the development of psychotic symptoms and suggest aberrant BOLD signal variability development as a potential biomarker for psychosis.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

abstract = {The complexity of neural dynamics stems in part from the complexity of the underlying anatomy. Yet how white matter structure constrains how the brain transitions from one cognitive state to another remains unknown. Here we address this question by drawing on recent advances in network control theory to model the underlying mechanisms of brain state transitions as elicited by the collective control of region sets. We find that previously identified attention and executive control systems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot easily be classified by traditional engineering-based notions of control. This theoretical versatility comes with a vulnerability to injury. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, we observe a loss of specificity in putative control processes, suggesting greater susceptibility to neurophysiological noise. These results offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving brain state transitions in healthy cognition and their alteration following injury.},

The notion of frequency and filters traditionally defined for signals supported on regular domains such as discrete time and image grids has been recently generalized to irregular graph domains, and defines brain graph frequencies associated with different levels of spatial smoothness across the brain regions. Brain network frequency also enables the decomposition of brain signals into pieces corresponding to smooth or rapid variations. We relate graph frequency with principal component analysis when the networks of interest denote functional connectivity. The methods are utilized to analyze brain networks and signals as subjects master a simple motor skill. We observe that brain signals corresponding to different graph frequencies exhibit different levels of adaptability throughout learning. Further, we notice a strong association between graph spectral properties of brain networks and the level of exposure to tasks performed, and recognize the most contributing and important frequency signatures at different task familiarity.},

For this problem (i) we propose a metric to quantify the difficulty of the control problem as a function of the required control energy, (ii) we derive bounds based on the system dynamics (network topology and weights) to characterize the tradeoff between the control energy and the number of control nodes, and (iii) we propose a distributed strategy with performance guarantees for the control of complex networks. In our strategy we select control nodes by relying on network partitioning, and we design the control input by leveraging optimal and distributed control techniques. Our findings show for instance that (i) if the number of control nodes is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of the network nodes, (ii) if the number of control nodes is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the network dimension, and (iii) clustered networks may be easier to control because, for sufficiently many control nodes, the control energy depends only on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social networks, and epidemics spreading.},

The framework reproduces the structural controllability of directed networks characterized by structural matrices. We explore the controllability of a large number of real and model networks, finding that dense networks with identical weights are difficult to be controlled.

abstract = {The brain's functional diversity is reflected in the meso-scale architecture of its connectome, i.e. its division into clusters and communities of topologically-related brain regions. The dominant view, and one that is reinforced by current analysis techniques, is that communities are strictly assortative and segregated from one another, purportedly for the purpose of carrying out specialized information processing. Such a view, however, precludes the possibility of non-assortative communities that could engender a richer functional repertoire by allowing for a more complex set of inter-community interactions. Here, we use weighted stochastic blockmodels to uncover the meso-scale architecture of $\backslash$emph{\{}Drosophila{\}}, mouse, rat, macaque, and human connectomes. We confirm that while many communities are assortative, others form core-periphery and disassortative structures, which in the human better recapitulate observed patterns of functional connectivity and in the mouse better recapitulate observed patterns of gene co-expression than other community detection techniques. We define a set of network measures for quantifying the diversity of community types in which brain regions participate. Finally, we show that diversity is peaked in control and subcortical systems in humans, and that individual differences in diversity within those systems predicts cognitive performance on Stroop and Navon tasks. In summary, our report paints a more diverse portrait of connectome meso-scale structure and demonstrates its relevance for cognitive performance.},

abstract = {Functional brain imaging has revealed two types of dynamic patterns of brain in the resting-state: the dynamics of spontaneous brain activities and the dynamics of functional interconnections between spontaneous brain activities. Although these two types of brain dynamics are usually investigated separately in the literature, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that they exhibit similar spatial patterns, suggesting the dynamics of spontaneous brain activities and the dynamics of their interconnections are associated with each other. In this study, we characterized the local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) dynamics and the functional connectivity (FC) dynamics in the resting-state, and then investigated their between-region associations. Time-varying FC was estimated as time-varying correlation coefficients using a sliding-window method, and the temporal variability of BOLD and time-varying FC were used to quantify the BOLD dynamics and the FC dynamics, respectively. Our results showed that the BOLD dynamics and the FC dynamics exhibit similar spatial patterns, and they are significantly associated across brain regions. Importantly, such associations are opposite for different types of FC (e.g. within-network FC dynamics are negatively correlated with the BOLD dynamics but the between-network FC dynamics are positively correlated with the BOLD dynamics), and they are spatially heterogeneous across brain networks. The identified heterogeneous associations between the BOLD dynamics and the FC dynamics appear to convey related or even distinct information and might underscore the potential mechanism of brain coordination and co-evolution.},

We then highlight current computational and theoretical frontiers, and emphasize their utility in informing diagnosis and monitoring, brain-machine interfaces, and brain stimulation.

Here, we demonstrate the use of a linear diffusion model to quantify the impact of these perturbations on brain connectiv-ity. We show that the eigenmodes governing the dynamics of this model are strongly con-served between healthy subjects regardless of cortical and sub-cortical parcellations, but show significant, interpretable deviations in improperly developed brains.

abstract = {Cognitive flexibility describes the human ability to switch between modes of mental function to achieve goals. Mental switching is accompanied by transient changes in brain activity, which must occur atop an anatomical architecture that bridges disparate cortical and subcortical regions by underlying white matter tracts. However, an integrated perspective regarding how white matter networks might constrain brain dynamics during cognitive processes requiring flexibility has remained elusive. To address this challenge, we applied emerging tools from graph signal processing to decompose BOLD signals based on diffusion imaging tractography in 28 individuals performing a perceptual task that probed cognitive flexibility. We found that the alignment between functional signals and the architecture of the underlying white matter network was associated with greater cognitive flexibility across subjects. Signals with behaviorally-relevant alignment were concentrated in the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with cortico-striatal mechanisms of cognitive flexibility. Importantly, these findings are not accessible to unimodal analyses of functional or anatomical neuroimaging alone. Instead, by taking a generalizable and concise reduction of multimodal neuroimaging data, we uncover an integrated structure-function driver of human behavior.},

We included 28 patients with 22q11DS presenting higher positive psychotic symptoms, 29 patients with lower positive psychotic symptoms and 69 healthy controls between 10 and 30. years old. To overcome limitations of mass-univariate approaches, we employed multivariate analysis, namely partial least squares correlation, combined with proper statistical testing, to analyze resting-state BOLD signal variability and its age-relationship in patients with positive psychotic symptoms. Our results revealed a missing positive age-relationship in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in patients with higher positive psychotic symptoms, leading to globally lower variability in the dACC in those patients. Patients without positive psychotic symptoms and healthy controls had the same developmental trajectory in this region. Alterations of brain structure and function in the ACC have been previously reported in 22q11DS and linked to psychotic symptoms. The present results support the implication of this region in the development of psychotic symptoms and suggest aberrant BOLD signal variability development as a potential biomarker for psychosis.},

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.},

Due to computational limits, connectivity is typically computed using pre-defined atlases, a non-trivial choice that might influence results. Here, we leverage new computational methods to retrieve dFC at the voxel level in terms of dominant patterns of fluctuations, and demonstrate that this new representation is informative to derive meaningful brain parcellations, capturing both long-range interactions and fine-scale local organization. Specifically, voxelwise dFC dominant patterns were captured through eigenvector centrality followed by clustering across time/subjects to yield most representative dominant patterns (RDPs). Voxel-wise labeling according to positive/negative contributions to RDPs, led to 37 unique labels identifying strikingly symmetric dFC long-range patterns. These included 449 contiguous regions, defining a fine-scale parcellation consistent with known cortical/subcortical subdivisions. Our contribution provides an alternative to obtain a whole-brain parcellation that is for the first time driven by voxel-level dFC and bridges the gap between voxel-based approaches and graph theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Large-scale organizational properties of brain networks mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging have been studied in a time-averaged sense. This is an oversimplification. We demonstrate that brain activity between multiple pairs of spatially distributed regions spontaneously fluctuates in and out of correlation over time in a globally coordinated manner, giving rise to sporadic intervals during which information can be efficiently exchanged between neuronal populations. We argue that dynamic fluctuations in the brain{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s organizational properties may minimize metabolic requirements while maintaining the brain in a responsive state.Neuronal dynamics display a complex spatiotemporal structure involving the precise, context-dependent coordination of activation patterns across a large number of spatially distributed regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has played a central role in demonstrating the nontrivial spatial and topological structure of these interactions, but thus far has been limited in its capacity to study their temporal evolution. Here, using high-resolution resting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human Connectome Project, we mapped time-resolved functional connectivity across the entire brain at a subsecond resolution with the aim of understanding how nonstationary fluctuations in pairwise interactions between regions relate to large-scale topological properties of the human brain. We report evidence for a consistent set of functional connections that show pronounced fluctuations in their strength over time. The most dynamic connections are intermodular, linking elements from topologically separable subsystems, and localize to known hubs of default mode and fronto-parietal systems. We found that spatially distributed regions spontaneously increased, for brief intervals, the efficiency with which they can transfer information, producing temporary, globally efficient network states. Our findings suggest that brain dynamics give rise to variations in complex network properties over time, possibly achieving a balance between efficient information-processing and metabolic expenditure.},

abstract = {Modern neuroimaging techniques provide us with unique views on brain structure and function; i.e., how the brain is wired, and where and when activity takes place. These large datasets contain increasingly rich information that can be analyzed in terms of network structure to reveal organizing principles at the systems level. Graph representations are versatile models where nodes are associated to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Structural graphs model neural pathways in white matter that are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs are built based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise measure of statistical interdependency between activity traces of regions. Therefore, most research to date has focussed on analyzing these graphs reflecting structure or function. Graph signal processing (GSP) is an emerging research theme where signals recorded at the nodes of the graph are analyzed taking into account the underlying graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations has been generalized to the graph setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a new viewpoint. Here, we introduce GSP for functional brain imaging and demonstrate its potential to integrate brain structure, contained in the graph itself, with brain function, residing in the graph signals. We show how brain activity can be meaningfully filtered based on concepts of spectral modes derived from brain structure. We also derive other operations such as surrogate data generation or decompositions informed by cognitive systems. In sum, GSP puts up a novel framework for the analysis of brain imaging data.},

Dedicated methods have been proposed to investigate co-variation of signals from different brain regions, with the goal of revealing neuronal networks (NNs) that may serve specialized functions. However, these analysis methods generally do not take into account a potential non-stationary (variable) interaction between brain regions, and as a result have limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel analysis method that uses clustering analysis to sort and selectively average fMRI activity time frames to produce a set of co-activation patterns. Compared to the established networks extracted with conventional analysis methods, these co-activation patterns demonstrate novel network features with apparent relevance to the brain's functional organization.},

However, the indirect nature of fMRI measurements can hinder the interpretability of the results.

abstract = {Functional connectivity provides an informative and powerful framework for exploring brain organization. Despite this, few statistical methods are available for the accurate estimation of dynamic changes in functional network architecture. To date, the majority of existing statistical techniques have assumed that connectivity structure is stationary, which is in direct contrast to emerging data that suggests that the strength of connectivity between regions is variable over time. Therefore, the development of statistical methods that enable exploration of dynamic changes in functional connectivity is currently of great importance to the neuroscience community. In this paper, we introduce the 'Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives' (MTD) and then demonstrate the utility of this metric to: (i) detect dynamic changes in connectivity using data from a novel state-switching simulation; (ii) accurately estimate graph structure in a previously-described 'ground-truth' simulated dataset; and (iii) identify task-driven alterations in functional connectivity. We show that the MTD is more sensitive than existing sliding-window methods in detecting dynamic alterations in connectivity structure across a range of correlation strengths and window lengths in simulated data. In addition to the temporal precision offered by MTD, we demonstrate that the metric is also able to accurately estimate stationary network structure in both simulated and real task-based data, suggesting that the method may be used to identify dynamic changes in network structure as they evolve through time.},

abstract = {Most statistical analyses of fMRI data assume that the nature, timing and duration of the psychological processes being studied are known. However, often it is hard to specify this information a priori. In this work we introduce a data-driven technique for partitioning the experimental time course into distinct temporal intervals with different multivariate functional connectivity patterns between a set of regions of interest (ROIs). The technique, called Dynamic Connectivity Regression (DCR), detects temporal change points in functional connectivity and estimates a graph, or set of relationships between ROIs, for data in the temporal partition that falls between pairs of change points. Hence, DCR allows for estimation of both the time of change in connectivity and the connectivity graph for each partition, without requiring prior knowledge of the nature of the experimental design. Permutation and bootstrapping methods are used to perform inference on the change points. The method is applied to various simulated data sets as well as to an fMRI data set from a study (N= 26) of a state anxiety induction using a socially evaluative threat challenge. The results illustrate the method's ability to observe how the networks between different brain regions changed with subjects' emotional state. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recently there has been an increased interest in using fMRI data to study the dynamic nature of brain connectivity. In this setting, the activity in a set of regions of interest (ROIs) is often modeled using a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with a mean vector and covariance matrix that are allowed to vary as the experiment progresses, representing changing brain states. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Connectivity Detection (DCD) algorithm, which is a data-driven technique to detect temporal change points in functional connectivity, and estimate a graph between ROIs for data within each segment defined by the change points. DCD builds upon the framework of the recently developed Dynamic Connectivity Regression (DCR) algorithm, which has proven efficient at detecting changes in connectivity for problems consisting of a small to medium ({\textless} 50) number of regions, but which runs into computational problems as the number of regions becomes large ({\textgreater}100). The newly proposed DCD method is faster, requires less user input, and is better able to handle high-dimensional data. It overcomes the shortcomings of DCR by adopting a simplified sparse matrix estimation approach and a different hypothesis testing procedure to determine change points. The application of DCD to simulated data, as well as fMRI data, illustrates the efficacy of the proposed method.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an experimental protocol to calculate the precision and accuracy of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and the orientation of the principal eigenvector (PEV) as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A healthy male volunteer was scanned in three separate scanning sessions, yielding a total of 45 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans. To provide FA, MD, and PEV as a function of SNR, sequential scans from a scan session were grouped into nonintersecting sets. Analysis of the accuracy and precision of the DTI-derived contrasts was done in both a voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-based manner. RESULTS: An upward bias of FA and no significant bias in MD were present as SNR decreased, confirming results from simulation-based studies. Notably, while the precision of the PEV became worse at low SNR, no bias in the PEV orientation was observed. Overall, an accurate and precise quantification of FA values in GM requires substantially more SNR than the quantification of white matter (WM) FA values CONCLUSION: This study provides guidance for FA, MD, and PEV quantification and a means to investigate the minimal detectable differences within and across scan sessions as a function of SNR.},

abstract = {Adolescence is marked by rapid development of executive function. Mounting evidence suggests that executive function in adults may be driven by dynamic control of neurophysiological processes. Yet, how these dynamics evolve over adolescence and contribute to cognitive development is unknown. In a sample of 780 youth aged 8–22 yr (42.7{\%} male) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort, we use a dynamic graph approach to extract activation states in BOLD fMRI data from 264 brain regions. We construct a graph in which each observation in time is a node and the similarity in brain states at two different times is an edge. Using this graphical approach, we identify two primary brain states reminiscent of intrinsic and task-evoked systems. We show that time spent in these two states is higher in older adolescents, as is the flexibility with which the brain switches between them. Increasing time spent in primary states and flexibility among states relates to increases in a complex executive accuracy factor score over adolescence. Flexibility is more positively associated with accuracy toward early adulthood. These findings suggest that brain state dynamics are associated with complex executive function across a critical period of adolescence.},

This paper presents an analysis on the impact of the variation of several acquisition parameters on these scalar measures with a novel double focus. First, a tractography-based approach is employed, motivated by the significant number of clinical studies that are carried out using this technique. Second, the consequences of simultaneous changes in multiple parameters are analyzed: number of gradient directions, b-value and voxel resolution. Results indicate that the FA is most affected by changes in the number of gradients and voxel resolution, while MD is specially influenced by variations in the b-value. Even if the choice of a tractography algorithm has an effect on the numerical values of the final scalar measures, the evolution of these measures when acquisition parameters are modified is parallel.},

abstract = {An optimization approach for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique is proposed, aiming to improve the estimates of tensors, fractional anisotropy (FA), and fiber directions. With the simulated annealing algorithm, the proposed approach simultaneously optimizes imaging parameters (gradient duration/separation, read-out time, and TE), b-values, and diffusion gradient directions either with or without incorporating prior knowledge of tensor fields. In addition, the method through which tensors are estimated, least squares in our study, was also considered in the optimization procedures. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed for three different scenarios of prior fiber distributions including fibers orientated in 1 (CONE1) and 3 (CONE3) cone areas (50 tensors orderly oriented within a diverging angle of 20° in each cone) and a uniform fiber distribution (UNIF). In addition, three imaging acquisition schemes together with different signal-to-noise ratios were tested, including M/N = 1/6, 2/12, and 5/30 for each prior fiber distribution where M and N were the number of b = 0 and b {\textgreater} 0 images, respectively. Our results show that the optimal b-value ranges between 0.7 and 1.0 × 109 s/m2 for UNIF. However, the optimal b-value ranges become both higher and wider for CONE1 and CONE3 than that of UNIF. In addition, the biases and standard deviations (SD) of tensors, and SD of FA are substantially reduced and the accuracy of fiber directional estimates is improved using the proposed approach particularly in CONE1 when compared with the conventional approaches. Together, the proposed unified optimization approach may offer a direct and simultaneous means to optimize DTI experiments. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Correction of echo planar imaging (EPI)-induced distortions (called "unwarping") improves anatomical fidelity for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional imaging investigations. Commonly used unwarping methods require the acquisition of supplementary images during the scanning session. Alternatively, distortions can be corrected by nonlinear registration to a non-EPI acquired structural image. In this study, we compared reliability using two methods of unwarping: (1) nonlinear registration to a structural image using symmetric normalization (SyN) implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs); and (2) unwarping using an acquired field map. We performed this comparison in two different test-retest data sets acquired at differing sites (N = 39 and N = 32). In both data sets, nonlinear registration provided higher test-retest reliability of the output fractional anisotropy (FA) maps than field map-based unwarping, even when accounting for the effect of interpolation on the smoothness of the images. In general, field map-based unwarping was preferable if and only if the field maps were acquired optimally.},

abstract = {Despite its great potential in studying brain anatomy and structure, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is marred by artefacts more than any other commonly used MRI technique. In this paper we present a non-parametric framework for detecting and correcting dMRI outliers (signal loss) caused by subject motion. Signal loss (dropout) affecting a whole slice, or a large connected region of a slice, is frequently observed in diffusion weighted images, leading to a set of unusable measurements. This is caused by bulk (subject or physiological) motion during the diffusion encoding part of the imaging sequence. We suggest a method to detect slices affected by signal loss and replace them by a non-parametric prediction, in order to minimise their impact on subsequent analysis. The outlier detection and replacement, as well as correction of other dMRI distortions (susceptibility-induced distortions, eddy currents (EC) and subject motion) are performed within a single framework, allowing the use of an integrated approach for distortion correction. Highly realistic simulations have been used to evaluate the method with respect to its ability to detect outliers (types 1 and 2 errors), the impact of outliers on retrospective correction of movement and distortion and the impact on estimation of commonly used diffusion tensor metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Data from a large imaging project studying older adults (the Whitehall Imaging sub-study) was used to demonstrate the utility of the method when applied to datasets with severe subject movement. The results indicate high sensitivity and specificity for detecting outliers and that their deleterious effects on FA and MD can be almost completely corrected.},

The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this coordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of diffusion imaging data from 882 youth ages 8 to 22 to show that white matter connectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted dynamics in development. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are negatively related to cognitive performance. Investigating structural mechanisms supporting these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set of growth rules. We find that all brain networks are structured in a manner highly optimized for network control, with distinct control mechanisms predicted in child versus older youth. We demonstrate that our results cannot be simply explained by changes in network modularity. This work reveals a possible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes dynamic network control over static network architecture.},

abstract = {Neurofeedback (NF) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) is an exciting neuroimaging application. In most rt-fMRI NF studies, the activity level of a single region of interest (ROI) is provided as a feedback signal, which the participants are trained to up or down-regulate. Neurofeedback training effects are typically analyzed using a confirmatory univariate approach, i.e., changes in the target ROI are explained by a univariate linear modulation. However, learning to self-regulate ROI activity through NF is mediated by distributed changes across the brain. Here we deploy a multivariate decoding model for assessing NF training effects across the whole brain. Specifically, we first explain the NF training effect by a post-hoc multivariate model that leads to a pattern of co-activation based on 90 functional atlas regions. We then use cross-validation to reveal the set of brain regions with the best fit. This novel approach was applied to data from a rt-fMRI NF study where participants learned to down-regulate the auditory cortex. We found that the optimal model consisted of 16 brain regions whose co-activation patterns best described the training effect over the NF training days. Cross-validation of the multivariate model showed that it generalized across participants. Interestingly, the participants could be clustered into two groups with distinct patterns of co-activation, potentially reflecting different NF learning strategies. Overall, our findings revealed that multiple brain regions are involved in learning to regulate activity in a single ROI, and thus lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying NF training.},

abstract = {Whole-brain network analysis of diffusion imaging tractography data is an important new tool for quantification of differential connectivity patterns across individuals and between groups. Here we investigate both the conservation of network architectural properties across methodological variation and the reproducibility of individual architecture across multiple scanning sessions. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were both acquired in triplicate from a cohort of healthy young adults. Deterministic tractography was performed on each dataset and inter-regional connectivity matrices were then derived by applying each of three widely used whole-brain parcellation schemes over a range of spatial resolutions. Across acquisitions and preprocessing streams, anatomical brain networks were found to be sparsely connected, hierarchical, and assortative. They also displayed signatures of topo-physical interdependence such as Rentian scaling. Basic connectivity properties and several graph metrics consistently displayed high reproducibility and low variability in both DSI and DTI networks. The relative increased sensitivity of DSI to complex fiber configurations was evident in increased tract counts and network density compared with DTI. In combination, this pattern of results shows that network analysis of human white matter connectivity provides sensitive and temporally stable topological and physical estimates of individual cortical structure across multiple spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has become a popular imaging modality for probing the microstructural properties of white matter and comparing them between populations in vivo. However, the contrast in DW-MRI arises from the microscopic random motion of water molecules in brain tissues, which makes it particularly sensitive to macroscopic head motion. Although this has been known since the introduction of DW-MRI, most studies that use this modality for group comparisons do not report measures of head motion for each group and rely on registration-based correction methods that cannot eliminate the full effects of head motion on the DW-MRI contrast. In this work we use data from children with autism and typically developing children to investigate the effects of head motion on differences in anisotropy and diffusivity measures between groups. We show that group differences in head motion can induce group differences in DW-MRI measures, and that this is the case even when comparing groups that include control subjects only, where no anisotropy or diffusivity differences are expected. We also show that such effects can be more prominent in some white-matter pathways than others, and that they can be ameliorated by including motion as a nuisance regressor in the analyses. Our results demonstrate the importance of taking head motion into account in any population study where one group might exhibit more head motion than the other. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function. We suggest that both task-driven neuronal responses and behavior are reflections of this dynamic, ongoing, functional organization of the brain.},

abstract = {Networks often exhibit structure at disparate scales. We propose a method for identifying community structure at different scales based on multiresolution modularity and consensus clustering. Our contribution consists of two parts. First, we propose a strategy for sampling the entire range of possible resolutions for the multiresolution modularity quality function. Our approach is directly based on the properties of modularity and, in particular, provides a natural way of avoiding the need to increase the resolution parameter by several orders of magnitude to break a few remaining small communities, necessitating the introduction of ad-hoc limits to the resolution range with standard sampling approaches. Second, we propose a hierarchical consensus clustering procedure, based on a modified modularity, that allows one to construct a hierarchical consensus structure given a set of input partitions. While here we are interested in its application to partitions sampled using multiresolution modularity, this consensus clustering procedure can be applied to the output of any clustering algorithm. As such, we see many potential applications of the individual parts of our multiresolution consensus clustering procedure in addition to using the procedure itself to identify hierarchical structure in networks.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction. Since its discovery as a major functional brain system, the default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, including ASD. We review converging multimodal evidence for DMN dysfunction in the context of specific components of social cognitive dysfunction in ASD—self-referential processing, which is the ability to process social information relative to oneself; and theory of mind or mentalizing, which is the ability to infer the mental states, such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions, of others. We show that altered functional and structural organization of the DMN and its atypical developmental trajectory are prominent neurobiological features of ASD. We integrate findings on atypical cytoarchitectonic organization and imbalance in excitatory-inhibitory circuits, which alter local and global brain signaling, to scrutinize putative mechanisms underlying DMN dysfunction in ASD. Our synthesis of the extant literature suggests that aberrancies in key nodes of the DMN and their dynamic functional interactions contribute to atypical integration of information about the self in relation to “other” as well as to impairments in the ability to flexibly attend to socially relevant stimuli. We conclude by highlighting open questions for future research.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with a reduction in resting state functional connectivity, though this assertion has recently been challenged by reports of increased connectivity in ASD. To address these contradictory findings, we examined both inter- and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in several resting state data sets acquired from adults with high-functioning ASD and matched control participants. Our results reveal areas of both increased and decreased connectivity in multiple ASD groups as compared to control groups. We propose that this heterogeneity stems from a previously unrecognized ASD characteristic: idiosyncratic distortions of the functional connectivity pattern relative to the typical, canonical template. The magnitude of an individual's pattern distortion in homotopic interhemispheric connectivity correlated significantly with behavioral symptoms of ASD. We propose that individualized alterations in functional connectivity organization are a core characteristic of high-functioning ASD, and that this may account for previous discrepant findings.},

We present theoretical and numerical results that provide new insights into the benefits and pitfalls of least-squares refitting. In particular, we consider both prediction and estimation, and we pay close attention to the effects of correlations in the design matrices of linear regression models, since these correlations - although often neglected - are crucial in the context of linear regression, especially in high dimensional contexts. First, we demonstrate that the benefit of least-squares refitting strongly depends on the setting and task under consideration: least-squares refitting can be beneficial even for settings with highly correlated design matrices but is not advisable for all settings, and least-squares refitting can be beneficial for estimation but performs better for prediction. Finally, we introduce a criterion that indicates whether least-squares refitting is advisable for a specific setting and task under consideration, and we conduct a thorough simulation study involving the Lasso to show the usefulness of this criterion.},

Most studies to date have examined age differences in functional connectivity via static indices that are computed over the entire blood-oxygen-level dependent time series. Little is known about the effects of age on short-term temporal dynamics of functional connectivity. Here, we examined age differences in dynamic connectivity as well as associations between connectivity, metabolic risk, and cognitive performance in healthy adults (N = 168; age, 18-83 years). A sliding-window k-means clustering approach was used to assess dynamic connectivity from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Three out of 8 dynamic connectivity profiles were associated with age. Furthermore, metabolic risk was associated with the relative amount of time allocated to 2 of these profiles. Finally, the relative amount of time allocated to a dynamic connectivity profile marked by heightened connectivity between default mode and medial temporal regions was positively associated with executive functions. Thus, dynamic connectivity analyses can enrich understanding of age-related differences beyond what is revealed by static analyses.},

abstract = {Introduction: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is dynamic in nature as neural activities constantly change over the time and are dominated by repeating brief activations and deactivations involving many brain regions. Each region participates in multiple brain functions and is part of various functionally distinct but spatially overlapping networks. Functional connectivity computed as correlations over the entire time series always overlooks interregion interactions that often occur repeatedly and dynamically in time, limiting its application to disease diagnosis. Aims: We develop a novel framework that uses short-time activation patterns of brain connectivity to better detect subtle disease-induced disruptions of brain connectivity. A clustering algorithm is first used to temporally decompose R-fMRI time series into distinct clusters with similar spatial distribution of neural activity based on the assumption that functionally distinct networks should be largely temporally distinct as brain states do not simultaneously coexist in general. A Pearson correlation-based functional connectivity network is then constructed for each cluster to allow for better exploration of spatiotemporal dynamics of individual neural activity. To reduce significant intersubject variability and to remove possible spurious connections, we use a group-constrained sparse regression model to construct a backbone sparse network for each cluster and use it to weight the corresponding Pearson correlation network. Results: The proposed method outperforms the conventional static, temporally dependent fully connected correlation-based networks by at least 7{\%} on a publicly available autism dataset. We were able to reproduce similar results using data from other centers. Conclusions: By combining the advantages of temporal independence and group-constrained sparse regression, our method improves autism diagnosis.

abstract = {We provide methods for estimating and testing multiple structural changes occurring at unknown dates in linear models using band spectral regressions. We consider changes over time within some frequency bands, permitting the coefficients to be different across frequency bands. Using standard assumptions, we show that the limit distributions obtained are similar to those in the time domain counterpart. We show that when the coefficients change only within some frequency band, we have increased efficiency of the estimates and power of the tests. We also discuss a very useful application related to contexts in which the data is contaminated by some low frequency process (e.g., level shifts or trends) and that the researcher is interested in whether the original non-contaminated model is stable. All that is needed to obtain estimates of the break dates and tests for structural changes that are not affected by such low frequency contaminations is to truncate a low frequency band that shrinks to zero at rate log(T)/T . Simulations show that the tests have good sizes for a wide range of truncations so that the method is quite robust. We analyze the stability of the relation between hours worked and productivity. When applying structural change tests in the time domain we document strong evidence of instabilities. When excluding a few low frequencies, none of the structural change tests are significant. Hence, the results provide evidence to the effect that the relation between hours worked and productivity is stable over any spectral band that excludes the lowest frequencies, in particular it is stable over the business-cycle band.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Networked systems display complex patterns of interactions between components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviours such as synchronization. Although descriptions of these behaviours are important, they are only a first step towards understanding and harnessing the relationship between network topology and system behaviour. Here, we use linear network control theory to derive accurate closed-form expressions that relate the connectivity of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from Drosophila, mouse, and human brains. We use these principles to suggest an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs while remaining robust to perturbations, and to perform clinically accessible targeted manipulation of the brain's control performance by removing single edges in the network. Generally, our results ground the expectation of a control system's behaviour in its network architecture, and directly inspire new directions in network analysis and design via distributed control. N etwork systems are composed of interconnected units that interact with each other on diverse temporal and spatial scales 1 . The exact patterns of interconnections between these units can take on many different forms that dictate how the system functions 2 . Indeed, specific features of network topology—such as small worldness 3 and modularity 4 —can improve efficiency and robustness. Yet, exact mechanisms driving the relationship between structure and function remain elusive, hampering the analysis, modification, and control of interconnected complex systems. The relationship between interconnection architecture and dynamics is particularly important in biological systems such as the brain 5 , where it is thought to support optimal information processing at cellular 6 and regional 7,8 levels. Understanding structure–function relationships in this system could inform personalized therapeutics 9},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by core sociocommunicative impairments. Atypical intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) has been reported in numerous studies of ASD. A majority of findings has indicated long-distance underconnectivity. However, fMRI studies have thus far exclusively examined static iFC across several minutes of scanning.We examined temporal variability of iFC, using sliding window analyses in selected high-quality (low-motion) consortium datasets from 76 ASD and 76 matched typically developing (TD) participants (Study 1) and in-house data from 32 ASD and 32 TD participants. Mean iFC and standard deviation of the sliding window correlation (SD-iFC) were computed for regions of interest (ROIs) from default mode and sa- lience networks, as well as amygdala and thalamus. In both studies, ROI pairings with significant underconnec- tivity (ASD{\textless}TD) were identified. Mediation analyses showed that decreased mean iFC in the ASD groups was significantly affected by increased SD-iFC. Our study is the first to identify temporal variability across time as a significant contributing factor to the common finding of static underconnectivity in ASD. Since peak connectivity across time was not significantly reduced in ASD, static underconnectivity findings may have to be reinterpreted, suggesting that connections are not actually ‘‘broken'' in ASD, but subject to greater intra-individual variability across time. Our findings indicate the need for dynamic approaches to iFC in clinical functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) investigations.},

We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.},

Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based; and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallows's Cp procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

abstract = {The organization of the human cerebral cortex has recently been explored using techniques for parcellating the cortex into distinct functionally coupled networks. The divergent and convergent nature of cortico-cortical anatomic connections suggests the need to consider the possibility of regions belonging to multiple networks and hierarchies among networks. Here we applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to solve for functionally coupled cerebral networks without assuming that cortical regions belong to a single network. Data analyzed included 1000 subjects from the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP) and 12 high quality individual subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The organization of the cerebral cortex was similar regardless of whether a winner-take-all approach or the more relaxed constraints of LDA (or ICA) were imposed. This suggests that large-scale networks may function as partially isolated modules. Several notable interactions among networks were uncovered by the LDA analysis. Many association regions belong to at least two networks, while somatomotor and early visual cortices are especially isolated. As examples of interaction, the precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex participate in multiple paralimbic networks that together comprise subsystems of the default network. In addition, regions at or near the frontal eye field and human lateral intraparietal area homologue participate in multiple hierarchically organized networks. These observations were replicated in both datasets and could be detected (and replicated) in individual subjects from the HCP. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies regularly use univariate general-linear-model-based analyses (GLM). Their findings are often inconsistent across different studies, perhaps because of several fundamental brain properties including functional heterogeneity, balanced excitation and inhibition (E/I), and sparseness of neuronal activities. These properties stipulate heterogeneous neuronal activities in the same voxels and likely limit the sensitivity and specificity of GLM. This paper selectively reviews findings of histological and electrophysiological studies and fMRI spatial independent component analysis (sICA) and reports new findings by applying sICA to two existing datasets. The extant and new findings consistently demonstrate several novel features of brain functional organization not revealed by GLM. They include overlap of large-scale functional networks (FNs) and their concurrent opposite modulations, and no significant modulations in activity of most FNs across the whole brain during any task conditions. These novel features of brain functional organization are highly consistent with the brain's properties of functional heterogeneity, balanced E/I, and sparseness of neuronal activity, and may help reconcile inconsistent GLM findings.},

abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables (factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

abstract = {Large efforts are currently under way to systematically map functional connectivity between all pairs of millimeter-scale brain regions based on large neuroimaging databases. The exploratory unraveling of this " functional connectome " based on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can benefit from a better understanding of the contributors to resting state functional connectivity. In this work, we introduce a sparse representation of fMRI data in the form of a discrete point-process encoding high-amplitude events in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal and we show it contains sufficient information for the estimation of functional connectivity between all pairs of voxels. We validate this method by replicating results obtained with standard whole-brain voxel-wise linear correlation matrices in two datasets. In the first one (n = 71), we study the changes in node strength (a measure of network centrality) during deep sleep. The second is a large database (n = 1147) of subjects in which we look at the age-related reorganization of the voxel-wise network of functional connections. In both cases it is shown that the proposed method compares well with standard techniques, despite requiring only data on the order of 1{\%} of the original BOLD signal time series. Furthermore, we establish that the point-process approach does not reduce (and in one case increases) classification accuracy compared to standard linear correlations. Our results show how large fMRI datasets can be drastically simplified to include only the timings of large-amplitude events, while still allowing the recovery of all pair-wise interactions between voxels. The practical importance of this dimensionality reduction is manifest in the increasing number of collaborative efforts aiming to study large cohorts of healthy subjects as well as patients suffering from brain disease. Our method also suggests that the electrophysiological signals underlying the dynamics of fMRI time series consist of all-or-none temporally localized events, analogous to the avalanches of neural activity observed in recordings of local field potentials (LFP), an observation of potentially high neurobiological relevance.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain function. Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitudeBOLDsignal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events.This idea is further explored here to demonstrate howbrain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease.},

Specifically, we consider the use of statistical null models for facilitating the principled identification of structural modules in semi-decomposable systems. Null models play an important role both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in the subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community structure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and show how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By considering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of network diagnostics over optimizations ("optimization variance") and over randomizations of network structure ("randomization variance"). Because the modularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly degenerate local optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to construct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for statistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ ensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators and empirical neuroscience data.},

The principled approach to establish their validity and usefulness is cross-validation, testing prediction on unseen data. Here, I would like to raise awareness on error bars of cross-validation, which are often underestimated. Simple experiments show that sample sizes of many neuroimaging studies inherently lead to large error bars, eg ±10{\%} for 100 samples. The standard error across folds strongly underestimates them. These large error bars compromise the reliability of conclusions drawn with predictive models, such as biomarkers or methods developments where, unlike with cognitive neuroimaging MVPA approaches, more samples cannot be acquired by repeating the experiment across many subjects. Solutions to increase sample size must be investigated, tackling possible increases in heterogeneity of the data.},

abstract = {22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) represents a homogeneous model of schizophrenia particularly suitable for the search of neural biomarkers of psychosis. Impairments in structural connectivity related to the presence of psychotic symptoms have been reported in patients with 22q11DS. However, the relationships between connectivity changes in patients with different symptomatic profiles are still largely unknown and warrant further investigations. In this study, we used structural connectivity to discriminate patients with 22q11DS with (N = 31) and without (N = 31) attenuated positive psychotic symptoms. Different structural connectivity measures were used, including the number of streamlines connecting pairs of brain regions, graph theoretical measures, and diffusion measures. We used univariate group comparisons as well as predictive multivariate approaches. The univariate comparison of connectivity measures between patients with or without attenuated positive psychotic symptoms did not give significant results. However, the multivariate prediction revealed that altered structural network architecture discriminates patient subtypes (accuracy = 67.7{\%}). Among the regions contributing to the classification we found the anterior cingulate cortex, which is known to be associated to the presence of psychotic symptoms in patients with 22q11DS. Furthermore, a significant discrimination (accuracy = 64{\%}) was obtained with fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the right cingulate gyrus. Our results point to alterations in structural network architecture and white matter microstructure in patients with 22q11DS with attenuated positive symptoms, mainly involving connections of the limbic system. These alterations may therefore represent a potential biomarker for an increased risk of psychosis that should be further tested in longitudinal studies.},

Yet, the use of networks is predicated on a critical simplifying assumption: that the quintessential unit of interest in a brain is a dyad -- two nodes (neurons or brain regions) connected by an edge. While rarely mentioned, this fundamental assumption inherently limits the types of neural structure and function that graphs can be used to model. Here, we describe a generalization of graphs that overcomes these limitations, thereby offering a broad range of new possibilities in terms of modeling and measuring neural phenomena. Specifically, we explore the use of $\backslash$emph{\{}simplicial complexes{\}}, a theoretical notion developed in the field of mathematics known as algebraic topology, which is now becoming applicable to real data due to a rapidly growing computational toolset. We review the underlying mathematical formalism as well as the budding literature applying simplicial complexes to neural data, from electrophysiological recordings in animal models to hemodynamic fluctuations in humans. Based on the exceptional flexibility of the tools and recent ground-breaking insights into neural function, we posit that this framework has the potential to eclipse graph theory in unraveling the fundamental mysteries of cognition.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has become a powerful tool for the study of functional networks in the brain. Even "at rest," the brain's different functional networks spontaneously fluctuate in their activity level; each network's spatial extent can therefore be mapped by finding temporal correlations between its different subregions. Current correlation-based approaches measure the average functional connectivity between regions, but this average is less meaningful for regions that are part of multiple networks; one ideally wants a network model that explicitly allows overlap, for example, allowing a region's activity pattern to reflect one network's activity some of the time, and another network's activity at other times. However, even those approaches that do allow overlap have often maximized mutual spatial independence, which may be suboptimal if distinct networks have significant overlap. In this work, we identify functionally distinct networks by virtue of their temporal independence, taking advantage of the additional temporal richness available via improvements in functional magnetic resonance imaging sampling rate. We identify multiple "temporal functional modes," including several that subdivide the default-mode network (and the regions anticorrelated with it) into several functionally distinct, spatially overlapping, networks, each with its own pattern of correlations and anticorrelations. These functionally distinct modes of spontaneous brain activity are, in general, quite different from resting-state networks previously reported, and may have greater biological interpretability.},

abstract = {22q11.2 Deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with numerous phenotypic consequences and is one of the greatest known risk factors for psychosis. We investigated intrinsic-connectivity-networks (ICNs) as potential biomarkers for patient and psychosis-risk status in 2 independent cohorts, UCLA (33 22q11DS-participants, 33 demographically matched controls), and Syracuse (28 22q11DS, 28 controls). After assessing group connectivity differences, ICNs from the UCLA cohort were used to train classifiers to distinguish cases from controls, and to predict psychosis risk status within 22q11DS; classifiers were subsequently tested on the Syracuse cohort. In both cohorts we observed significant hypoconnectivity in 22q11DS relative to controls within anterior cingulate (ACC)/precuneus, executive, default mode (DMN), posterior DMN, and salience networks. Of 12 ICN-derived classifiers tested in the Syracuse replication-cohort, the ACC/precuneus, DMN, and posterior DMN classifiers accurately distinguished between 22q11DS and controls. Within 22q11DS subjects, connectivity alterations within 4 networks predicted psychosis risk status for a given individual in both cohorts: the ACC/precuneus, DMN, left executive, and salience networks. Widespread within-network-hypoconnectivity in large-scale networks implicated in higher-order cognition may be a defining characteristic of 22q11DS during adolescence and early adulthood; furthermore, loss of coherence within these networks may be a valuable biomarker for individual prediction of psychosis-risk in 22q11DS.},

abstract = {The central nervous system is composed of many individual units -- from cells to areas -- that are connected with one another in a complex pattern of functional interactions that supports perception, action, and cognition. One natural and parsimonious representation of such a system is a graph in which nodes (units) are connected by edges (interactions). While applicable across spatiotemporal scales, species, and cohorts, the traditional graph approach is unable to address the complexity of time-varying connectivity patterns that may be critically important for an understanding of emotional and cognitive state, task-switching, adaptation and development, or aging and disease progression. Here we survey a set of tools from applied mathematics that offer measures to characterize dynamic graphs. Along with this survey, we offer suggestions for visualization and a publicly-available MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the application of these metrics to existing or yet-to-be acquired neuroimaging data. We illustrate the toolbox by applying it to a previously published data set of time-varying functional graphs, but note that the tools can also be applied to time-varying structural graphs or to other sorts of relational data entirely. Our aim is to provide the neuroimaging community with a useful set of tools, and an intuition regarding how to use them, for addressing emerging questions that hinge on accurate and creative analyses of dynamic graphs.},

abstract = {The aim of this guidance paper of the European Psychiatric Association is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the early detection of a clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis in patients with mental problems. To this aim, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting on conversion rates to psychosis in non-overlapping samples meeting any at least any one of the main CHR criteria: ultra-high risk (UHR) and/or basic symptoms criteria. Further, effects of potential moderators (different UHR criteria definitions, single UHR criteria and age) on conversion rates were examined. Conversion rates in the identified 42 samples with altogether more than 4000 CHR patients who had mainly been identified by UHR criteria and/or the basic symptom criterion ‘cognitive disturbances' (COGDIS) showed considerable heterogeneity. While UHR criteria and COGDIS were related to similar conversion rates until 2-year follow-up, conversion rates of COGDIS were significantly higher thereafter. Differences in onset and frequency requirements of symptomatic UHR criteria or in their different consideration of functional decline, substance use and co-morbidity did not seem to impact on conversion rates. The ‘genetic risk and functional decline' UHR criterion was rarely met and only showed an insignificant pooled sample effect. However, age significantly affected UHR conversion rates with lower rates in children and adolescents. Although more research into potential sources of heterogeneity in conversion rates is needed to facilitate improvement of CHR criteria, six evidence-based recommendations for an early detection of psychosis were developed as a basis for the EPA guidance on early intervention in CHR states.},

abstract = {Neural ensembles oscillate across a broad range of frequencies and are transiently coupled or "bound" together when people attend to a stimulus, perceive, think, and act. This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain engaging and disengaging in time. But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions. How does the transient coupling of neural ensembles that supports cognitive function occur? Tognoli and Kelso consider a mechanism known as metastability, discussing theory and data at multiple scales that suggest that metastable dynamics underlies the coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic functions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although the impact of serial correlation (autocorrelation) in residuals of general linear models for fMRI time-series has been studied extensively, the effect of autocorrelation on functional connectivity studies has been largely neglected until recently. Some recent studies based on results from economics have questioned the conventional estimation of functional connectivity and argue that not correcting for autocorrelation in fMRI time-series results in "spurious" correlation coefficients. In this paper, first we assess the effect of autocorrelation on Pearson correlation coefficient through theoretical approximation and simulation. Then we present this effect on real fMRI data. To our knowledge this is the first work comprehensively investigating the effect of autocorrelation on functional connectivity estimates. Our results show that although FC values are altered, even following correction for autocorrelation, results of hypothesis testing on FC values remain very similar to those before correction. In real data we show this is true for main effects and also for group difference testing between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. We further discuss model order selection in the context of autoregressive processes, effects of frequency filtering and propose a preprocessing pipeline for connectivity studies. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Variability of neuronal responses is thought to underlie flexible and optimal brain function. Because previous work investigating BOLD signal variability has been conducted within task-based fMRI contexts on adults and older individuals, very little is currently known regarding regional changes in spontaneous BOLD signal variability in the human brain across the lifespan. The current study used resting-state fMRI data from a large sample of male and female human participants covering a wide age range (6-85 years) across two different fMRI acquisition parameters (TR = 0.645 and 1.4 s). Variability in brain regions including a key node of the salience network (anterior insula) increased linearly across the lifespan across datasets. In contrast, variability in most other large-scale networks decreased linearly over the lifespan. These results demonstrate unique lifespan trajectories of BOLD variability related to specific regions of the brain and add to a growing literature demonstrating the importance of identifying normative trajectories of functional brain maturation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although brain signal variability has traditionally been considered a source of unwanted noise, recent work demonstrates that variability in brain signals during task performance is related to brain maturation in old age as well as individual differences in behavioral performance. The current results demonstrate that intrinsic fluctuations in resting-state variability exhibit unique maturation trajectories in specific brain regions and systems, particularly those supporting salience detection. These results have implications for investigations of brain development and aging, as well as interpretations of brain function underlying behavioral changes across the lifespan.},

abstract = {Objectives: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), also known as velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) or DiGeorge Syndrome, is a genetic disorder due to a micro deletion on chromosome 22q11.2. VCFS is associated with abnormalities in brain structure and with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. The aim of this review was to statistically summarize the structural imaging literature on VCFS which due to the relatively rarity of the disorder tends to consider small sample sizes. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of region of interest (ROI) studies comparing VCFS with healthy controls was carried out. Significant heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression. Results: Subjects with VCFS were characterised by global brain volumetric reduction including several cortical regions, cerebellum and hippocampus. The area of the corpus callosum was increased. Conclusions: Many regions extensively studied in schizophrenia were not covered in the existing VCFS literature. However, the studies considered support volumetric abnormalities which may help explain why VCFS is associated with a greatly increased risk of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The control of brain dynamics provides great promise for the enhancement of cognitive function in humans, and by extension the betterment of their quality of life. Yet, successfully controlling dynamics in neural systems is particularly challenging, not least due to the immense complexity of the brain and the large set of interactions that can affect any single change. While we have gained some understanding of the control of single neurons, the control of large-scale neural systems---networks of multiply interacting components---remains poorly understood. Efforts to address this gap include the recent development of new tools for the control of brain networks, mostly adapted from control and dynamical systems theory. These theoretical contributions provide new models that draw from a wide array of mathematical approaches, and have been directly informed by current opportunities for practical intervention. We present intriguing recent developments for strategies of control in dynamic brain networks, and we also describe potential mechanisms that underlie such processes. We review efforts in the control of general neurophysiological processes with implications for brain development and cognitive function, as well as the control of altered neurophysiological processes in medical contexts such as anesthesia administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. We conclude by highlighting new results from network control---especially approaches that deal with nonlinear dynamics or more realistic trajectories for control transitions---that could be of great relevance to addressing pressing questions in neuroscience.},

abstract = {The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is characterized by high rates of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia, making this condition a promising human model for studying risk factors for psychosis. We explored the predictive value of ultra high risk (UHR) criteria in a sample of patients with 22q11DS. We also examined the additional contribution of socio-demographic, clinical and cognitive variables to predict transition to psychosis within a mean interval of 32.5 ± 17.6 months after initial assessment. Eighty-nine participants with 22q11DS (age range: 8-30 years; mean 16.1 ± 4.7) were assessed using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes. Information on Axis I diagnoses, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, level of functioning and IQ was also collected. At baseline, 22 (24.7{\%}) participants met UHR criteria. Compared to those without a UHR condition, they had a significantly lower functioning, more frequent anxiety disorders, and more severe psychopathology. Transition rate to psychosis was 27.3{\%} in UHR and 4.5{\%} in non-UHR participants. Cox regression analyses revealed that UHR status significantly predicted conversion to psychosis. Baseline level of functioning was the only other additional predictor. This is the first study investigating the predictive value of UHR criteria in 22q11DS. It indicates that the clinical path leading to psychosis is broadly comparable to that observed in other clinical high-risk samples. Nevertheless, the relatively high transition rate in non-UHR individuals suggests that other risk markers should be explored in this population. The role of low functioning as a predictor of transition to psychosis should also be investigated more in depth.},

Furthermore, negative symptoms exist in up to 80{\%} of patients diagnosed with 22q11DS. The present study aims to uncover morphological brain alterations associated with negative symptoms in a cohort of patients with 22q11DS who are at-risk for developing schizophrenia. A total of 71 patients with 22q11DS aged 12 to 35 (54{\%} females) with no past or present diagnosis of a schizophrenia were included in the study. Psychotic symptom scores were used to divide patients into subgroups by means of a cluster analysis. Three major subgroups were evident: patients with low negative and positive symptoms; patients with high negative symptoms and low positive symptoms; and patients with high negative and positive symptoms. Cortical volume, thickness and gyrification were compared between subgroups using FreeSurfer software. Results showed that patients with high negative symptoms, compared to those with low negative symptoms, have decreased gyrification in the medial occipito-temporal (MOT) and lateral temporo-parietal (LTP) cortices of the left hemisphere, and in the medial temporal (MT)/posterior cingulate (PCC) cortices of the right hemisphere. These findings suggest that high negative symptoms are associated with gyrification reductions predominantly in medial occipital and temporal regions, which are areas implicated in social cognition and early visual processing. Furthermore, as cortical folding develops in utero and during the first years of life, reduced gyrification may represent an early biomarker predicting the development of negative symptoms.},

abstract = {While autism and ADHD are considered distinct conditions from a diagnostic perspective, they share some phenotypic features and have high comorbidity. Taking a dual-condition approach might help elucidate shared and distinct neural characteristics. Graph theory was used to analyse properties of cortical thickness structural covariance networks across both conditions and relative to a neurotypical (NT; n=87) group using data from the ABIDE (autism; n=62) and ADHD-200 datasets (ADHD; n=69). This was analysed in a theoretical framework examining potential differences in long and short range connectivity. We found convergence between autism and ADHD, where both conditions show an overall decrease in CT covariance with increased Euclidean distance compared to a neurotypical population. The two conditions also show divergence: less modular overlap between the two conditions than there is between each condition and the neurotypical group. Lastly, the ADHD group also showed reduced wiring costs compared to the autism groups. Our results indicate a need for taking an integrated approach when considering highly comorbid conditions such as autism and ADHD. Both groups show a distance-covariance relation that more strongly favours short-range over long-range. Thus, on some network features the groups seem to converge, yet on others there is divergence.},

abstract = {The transition from childhood to adulthood is marked by pronounced functional and structural brain transformations that impact cognition and behavior. Here, we use a functional imaging approach to reveal dynamic changes in coupling strength between networks and the expression of discrete brain configurations over human development during rest and a cognitive control task. Although the brain's repertoire of functional states was generally preserved across ages, state-specific temporal features, such as the frequency of expression and the amount of time spent in select states, varied by age in ways that were dependent on condition. Increasing age was associated with greater variability of connection strengths across time at rest, while there was a selective inversion of this effect in higher-order networks during implementation of cognitive control. The results suggest that development is characterized by the modi-fication of dynamic coupling to both maximize and constrain functional variability in response to ongoing cognitive and behavioral requirements.},

Cross-sectional case-control studies in different age groups have suggested that deficits in cortical thickness in childhood-onset schizophrenia may normalize over time, suggesting a disorder-related difference in cortical growth trajectories. Methods We acquired magnetic resonance imaging scans repeated over several years for each subject, in a sample of 106 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 102 age-matched healthy volunteers. Using semiparametric regression, we modeled the effect of schizophrenia on the growth curve of cortical thickness in {\~{}}80,000 locations across the cortex, in the age range 8 to 30 years. In addition, we derived normative developmental modules composed of cortical regions with similar maturational trajectories for cortical thickness in typical brain development. Results We found abnormal nonlinear growth processes in prefrontal and temporal areas that have previously been implicated in schizophrenia, distinguishing for the first time between cortical areas with age-constant deficits in cortical thickness and areas whose maturational trajectories are altered in schizophrenia. In addition, we showed that when the brain is divided into five normative developmental modules, the areas with abnormal cortical growth overlap significantly only with the cingulo-fronto-temporal module. Conclusions These findings suggest that abnormal cortical development in schizophrenia may be modularized or constrained by the normal community structure of developmental modules of the human brain connectome. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has highlighted the rich structure of brain activity in absence of a task or stimulus. A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity (FC), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state fMRI experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of dFC could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the dFC approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of dFC analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis present with emerging symptoms and decline in functioning. Previous univariate analyses have indicated widespread white matter (WM) aberrations in multiple brain regions in UHR individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Using multivariate statistics, we investigated whole brain WM microstructure and associations between WM, clinical symptoms, and level of functioning in UHR individuals. METHODS Forty-five UHR individuals and 45 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 3 Tesla. UHR individuals were assessed with the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. Partial least-squares correlation analysis (PLSC) was used as statistical method. RESULTS PLSC group comparisons revealed one significant latent variable (LV) accounting for 52{\%} of the cross-block covariance. This LV indicated a pattern of lower fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and mode of anisotropy (MO) concomitant with higher radial diffusivity (RD) in widespread brain regions in UHR individuals compared with HCs. Within UHR individuals, PLSC revealed five significant LVs associated with symptoms and level of functioning. The first LV accounted for 31{\%} of the cross-block covariance and indicated a pattern where higher symptom score and lower level of functioning correlated to lower FA, AD, MO, and higher RD. CONCLUSIONS UHR individuals demonstrate complex brain patterns of WM abnormalities. Despite the subtle psychopathology of UHR individuals, aberrations in WM appear associated with positive and negative symptoms as well as level of functioning.},

abstract = {Understanding how brain development normally proceeds is a premise of understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. This has sparked a wealth of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Unfortunately, they are in marked disagreement on how the cerebral cortex matures. While cortical thickness increases for the first 8-9 years of life have repeatedly been reported, others find continuous cortical thinning from early childhood, at least from age 3 or 4 years. We review these inconsistencies, and discuss possible reasons, including the use of different scanners, recording parameters and analysis tools, and possible effects of variables such as head motion. When tested on the same subsample, 2 popular thickness estimation methods (CIVET and FreeSurfer) both yielded a continuous thickness decrease from 3 years. Importantly, MRI-derived measures of cortical development are merely our best current approximations, hence the term "apparent cortical thickness" may be preferable. We recommend strategies for reaching consensus in the field, including multimodal neuroimaging to measure phenomena using different techniques, for example, the use of T1/T2 ratio, and data sharing to allow replication across analysis methods. As neurodevelopmental origins of early- and late-onset disease are increasingly recognized, resolving inconsistencies in brain maturation trajectories is important.},

In this new frequency-specific representation of cortical activity, that we call 'connectome harmonics', oscillatory networks of the human brain at rest match harmonic wave patterns of certain frequencies. We demonstrate a neural mechanism behind the self-organization of connectome harmonics with a continuous neural field model of excitatory-inhibitory interactions on the connectome. Remarkably, the critical relation between the neural field patterns and the delicate excitation-inhibition balance fits the neurophysiological changes observed during the loss and recovery of consciousness.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

A well-established stream of literature on firms' external knowledge search has demonstrated that firms investing in broader search may have a great ability to innovate. In this paper, we explore the influences of technology search on firms' technological innovation performance along three distinctive dimensions: technical, geographic, and temporal dimensions, using a unique panel data set containing information on Chinese firms that were active in technology in-licensing and patenting during the period 2000-2009. Our findings reveal that Chinese firms' technological innovation performances are related to external technology search in quite different ways from the ones suggested in the extant literature using evidence from developed countries. We find that Chinese firms searching locally' along the technical dimension have better technological innovation performance than those searching distantly'. However, when a Chinese firm in-license relatively old (mature) technologies or those from geographically nearby areas, it will be less bounded to searching familiar technical knowledge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Patients with schizophrenia show deficits in early-stage visual processing, potentially reflecting dysfunction of the magnocellular visual pathway. The magnocellular system operates normally in a nonlinear amplification mode mediated by glutamatergic (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. Investigating magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia therefore permits evaluation of underlying etiologic hypotheses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES:To evaluate magnocellular dysfunction in schizophrenia, relative to known neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates, and to examine relationships between electrophysiological and behavioral measures of visual pathway dysfunction and relationships with higher cognitive deficits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:Between-group study at an inpatient state psychiatric hospital and outpatient county psychiatric facilities. Thirty-three patients met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 21 nonpsychiatric volunteers of similar ages composed the control group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:(1) Magnocellular and parvocellular evoked potentials, analyzed using nonlinear (Michaelis-Menten) and linear contrast gain approaches; (2) behavioral contrast sensitivity measures; (3) white matter integrity; (4) visual and nonvisual neuropsychological measures, and (5) clinical symptom and community functioning measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Patients generated evoked potentials that were significantly reduced in response to magnocellular-biased, but not parvocellular-biased, stimuli (P = .001). Michaelis-Menten analyses demonstrated reduced contrast gain of the magnocellular system (P = .001). Patients showed decreased contrast sensitivity to magnocellular-biased stimuli (P{\textless}.001). Evoked potential deficits were significantly related to decreased white matter integrity in the optic radiations (P{\textless}.03). Evoked potential deficits predicted impaired contrast sensitivity (P = .002), which was in turn related to deficits in complex visual processing (P{\textless} or =.04). Both evoked potential (P{\textless} or =.04) and contrast sensitivity (P = .01) measures significantly predicted community functioning.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:These findings confirm the existence of early-stage visual processing dysfunction in schizophrenia and provide the first evidence that such deficits are due to decreased nonlinear signal amplification, consistent with glutamatergic theories. Neuroimaging studies support the hypothesis of dysfunction within low-level visual pathways involving thalamocortical radiations. Deficits in early-stage visual processing significantly predict higher cognitive deficits.},

abstract = {Visual processing deficits are an integral component of schizophrenia and are sensitive predictors of schizophrenic decompensation in healthy adults. The primate visual system consists of discrete subcortical magnocellular and parvocellular pathways, which project preferentially to dorsal and ventral cortical streams. Subcortical systems show differential stimulus sensitivity, while cortical systems, in turn, can be differentiated using surface potential analysis. The present study examined contributions of subcortical dysfunction to cortical processing deficits using high-density event-related potentials. Event-related potentials were recorded to stimuli biased towards the magnocellular system using low-contrast isolated checks in Experiment 1 and towards the magnocellular or parvocellular system using low versus high spatial frequency (HSF) sinusoidal gratings, respectively, in Experiment 2. The sample consisted of 23 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 non-psychiatric volunteers of similar age. In Experiment 1, a large decrease in the P1 component of the visual event-related potential in response to magnocellular-biased isolated check stimuli was seen in patients compared with controls (F = 13.2, P = 0.001). Patients also showed decreased slope of the contrast response function over the magnocellular-selective contrast range compared with controls (t = 9.2, P = 0.04) indicating decreased signal amplification. In Experiment 2, C1 (F = 8.5, P = 0.007), P1 (F = 33.1, P {\textless} 0.001) and N1 (F = 60.8, P {\textless} 0.001) were reduced in amplitude to magnocellular-biased low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli in patients with schizophrenia, but were intact to parvocellular-biased HSF stimuli, regardless of generator location. Source waveforms derived from inverse dipole modelling showed reduced P1 in Experiment 1 and reduced C1, P1 and N1 to LSF stimuli in Experiment 2, consistent with surface waveforms. These results indicate pervasive magnocellular dysfunction at the subcortical level that leads to secondary impairment in activation of cortical visual structures within dorsal and ventral stream visual pathways. Our finding of early visual dysfunction is consistent with and explanatory of classic literature showing subjective complaints of visual distortions and is consistent with early visual processing deficits reported in schizophrenia. Although deficits in visual processing have frequently been construed as resulting from failures of top-down processing, the present findings argue strongly for bottom-up rather than top-down dysfunction at least within the early visual pathway. Deficits in magnocellular processing in this task may reflect more general impairments in neuronal systems functioning, such as deficits in non-linear amplification and may thus represent an organizing principle for predicting neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

Computational image analysis methods allow spatially detailed cortical thickness measurements across the entire cortex in 3D, but have not addressed thickness changes in cingulate or other cortices bordering the medial walls of the cerebral hemispheres in first episode schizophrenia. Methods: Magnetic resonance images and cortical pattern matching methods were used to compare gray matter thickness, measured at sub-voxel resolution at thousands of spatially equivalent locations on the medial hemispheric surfaces, between 72 (51m/21f) first episode schizophrenia patients and 78 (37m/41f) healthy controls similar in age. Group differences were mapped in 3D, and their overall significance was confirmed by permutation testing. Results: Patients with little or no prior antipsychotic medication treatment showed significant cortical thinning within cingulate, occipital and frontopolar cortices with no significant increases in any cortical location. Regional sex differences were observed with pronounced thinning in the left paracentral lobule and right posterior cingulate in male and female patients respectively compared to same sex controls. Conclusions: Cortical thinning may correspond to cytoarchitectural and neurochemical abnormalities observed in similar anatomic locations and may underlie systems-wise disturbances that include heteromodal association cortices, where cortical thinning has been previously observed in first episode schizophrenia. ?? 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social impairments alongside cognitive and behavioral inflexibility. While social deficits in ASDs have extensively been characterized, the neurobiological basis of inflexibility and its relation to core clinical symptoms of the disorder are unknown. We acquired functional neuroimaging data from 2 cohorts, each consisting of 17 children with ASDs and 17 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children, during stimulus-evoked brain states involving performance of social attention and numerical problem solving tasks, as well as during intrinsic, resting brain states. Effective connectivity between key nodes of the salience network, default mode network, and central executive network was used to obtain indices of functional organization across evoked and intrinsic brain states. In both cohorts examined, a machine learning algorithm was able to discriminate intrinsic (resting) and evoked (task) functional brain network configurations more accurately in TD children than in children with ASD. Brain state discriminability was related to severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors, indicating that weak modulation of brain states may contribute to behavioral inflexibility in ASD. These findings provide novel evidence for a potential link between neurophysiological inflexibility and core symptoms of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia--a severe psychiatric condition characterized by hallucinations, delusions, loss of initiative and cognitive function--is hypothesized to result from abnormal anatomical neural connectivity and a consequent decoupling of the brain's integrative thought processes. The rise of in vivo neuroimaging techniques has refueled the formulation of dysconnectivity hypotheses, linking schizophrenia to abnormal structural and functional connectivity in the brain at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Over the past few years, advances in high-field structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have made it increasingly feasible to reconstruct comprehensive maps of the macroscopic neural wiring system of the human brain, know as the connectome. In parallel, advances in network science and graph theory have improved our ability to study the spatial and topological organizational layout of such neural connectivity maps in detail. Combined, the field of neural connectomics has created a novel platform that provides a deeper understanding of the overall organization of brain wiring, its relation to healthy brain function and human cognition, and conversely, how brain disorders such as schizophrenia arise from abnormal brain network wiring and dynamics. In this review we discuss recent findings of connectomic studies in schizophrenia that examine how the disorder relates to disruptions of brain connectivity.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is associated with fronto-temporal dysconnectivity, but it is not clear whether this is a risk factor for the disorder or is a consequence of the established illness. The aim of the present study was to use fMRI to investigate fronto-temporal connectivity in subjects with prodromal signs of schizophrenia using the Hayling Sentence Completion Task (HSCT). Thirty participants, 15 with an at risk mental state (ARMS) and 15 healthy controls were scanned whilst completing 80 sentence stems. The congruency and constraint of sentences varied across trials. Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) and Bayesian model selection (BMS) were used to compare alternative models of connectivity in a task related network. During the HSCT ARMS subjects did not differ from Healthy Controls in terms of fronto-temporal activation, i.e. there was neither a main effect of group nor a group-by-task interaction. However, there was both a significant main effect of group and a significant interaction in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with greater ACC activity in the ARMS subjects. A systematic BMS procedure among 14 alternative DCMs including the ACC, middle frontal, and middle temporal gyri revealed intact task-dependent modulation of fronto-temporal effective connectivity in the ARMS group. However, ARMS subjects showed increased endogenous connection strength between the ACC and the middle temporal gyrus relative to healthy controls. Although task related fronto-temporal integration in the ARMS was intact, this may depend on increased engagement of the ACC which was not observed in healthy control subjects. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The disconnection hypothesis suggests that the core symptoms of schizophrenia (SZ) are related to aberrant, or 'dys-', connectivity between distinct brain regions. A proliferation of functional and structural neuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate this hypothesis, across the full course of the disorder; from people at Ultra-High-Risk of developing psychosis to patients with chronic SZ. However the results of these studies have not always been consistent, and to date, there have been no attempts to summarise the results of both methodologies in conjunction. In this article, we systematically review both the structural and functional connectivity literature in SZ. The main trends to emerge are that schizophrenia is associated with connectivity reductions, as opposed to increases, relative to healthy controls, and that this is particularly evident in the connections involving the frontal lobe. These two trends appear to apply across all stages of the disorder, and to be independent of the neuroimaging methodology employed. We discuss the potential implications of these trends, and identify possible future investigative directions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The onset of positive symptoms in schizophrenia is often preceded by a prodromal phase characterized by neurocognitive abnormalities as well as changes in brain structure and function. Increasing efforts have been made to identify individuals at elevated risk of developing schizophrenia, as early intervention may help prevent progression towards psychosis. The present study uses functional MRI and graph theoretical analysis to characterize the organization of a functional brain network in at-risk mental state patients with varying symptoms assessed with the PANSS and healthy volunteers during performance of a verbal fluency task known to recruit frontal lobe networks and to be impaired in psychosis. We first examined between-groups differences in total network connectivity and global network compactness/efficiency. We then addressed the role of specific brain regions in the network organization by calculating the node-specific "betweeness centrality", "degree centrality" and "local average path length" metrics; different ways of assessing a region's importance in a network. We focused our analysis on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); a region known to support executive function that is structurally and functionally impaired in at-risk mental state patients. Although global network connectivity and efficiency were maintained in at-risk patients relative to the controls, we report a significant decrease in the contribution of the ACC to task-relevant network organization in at risk subjects with elevated symptoms (PANSS ??? 45) relative to both the controls and the less symptomatic at-risk subjects, as reflected by a reduction in the topological centrality of the ACC. These findings provide evidence of network abnormalities and anterior cingulate cortex dysfunction in people with prodromal signs of schizophrenia. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Neuroimaging and electrophysiologic studies have consistently provided evidence of impairment in anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex function in people with schizophrenia. In this study, we sought to clarify the nature of this abnormality by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3T. Methods: We used single-voxel MRS acquired in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and fMRI during performance of a Stroop color-naming task to investigate the neurochemistry and functional response of the anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex in 26 stable, medicated subjects with schizophrenia and 23 matched healthy control subjects. Results: In schizophrenia subjects, we found decreased blood oxygen leveldependent signal in the medial frontal wall, with significant clusters restricted to more dorsal regions compared with healthy subjects. In addition, we observed a trend-level decrease in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) levels and a significant positive correlation between NAA/Cr level and the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in schizophrenia subjects that did not exist in healthy subjects. Furthermore, in this group of medicated subjects, we did not find evidence of decreased glutamate + glutamine(Glx)/Cr levels, but there was a significant negative correlation between Glx/Cr levels and negative symptoms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that abnormal NAA levels, which may reflect a neuronal dysfunction related to schizophrenia, affect neuronal physiology, as evidenced by reduced blood oxygen leveldependent response. ?? 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Background: Abnormalities of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are frequently implicated in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders, but whether such changes are apparent before psychosis onset remains unclear. In this study, we characterized prepsychotic ACC abnormalities in a sample of individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis. Methods: Participants underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging and were followed-up over 12-24 months to ascertain diagnostic outcomes. Baseline ACC morphometry was then compared between UHR individuals who developed psychosis (UHR-P; n = 35), those who did not (UHR-NP; n = 35), and healthy control subjects (n = 33). Results: Relative to control subjects, UHR-P individuals displayed bilateral thinning of a rostral paralimbic ACC region that was negatively correlated with negative symptoms, whereas UHR-NP individuals displayed a relative thickening of dorsal and rostral limbic areas that was correlated with anxiety ratings. Baseline ACC differences between the two UHR groups predicted time to psychosis onset, independently of symptomatology. Subdiagnostic comparisons revealed that changes in the UHR-P group were driven by individuals subsequently diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. Conclusions: These findings indicate that anatomic abnormalities of the ACC precede psychosis onset and that baseline ACC differences distinguish between UHR individuals who do and do not subsequently develop frank psychosis. They also indicate that prepsychotic changes are relatively specific to individuals who develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, suggesting they may represent a diagnostically specific risk marker. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a functionally heterogeneous region involved in diverse cognitive and emotional processes that support goal-directed behaviour. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropathological findings over the past two decades have converged to suggest abnormalities in the region may represent a neurobiological basis for many of the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia. However, while each approach offers complimentary information that can provide clues regarding underlying patholophysiological processes, the findings from these 2 fields are seldom integrated. In this article, we review structural neuroimaging and neuropathological studies of the ACC, focusing on the unique information they provide. The available imaging data suggest grey matter reductions in the ACC precede psychosis onset in some categories of high-risk individuals, show sub-regional specificity, and may progress with illness duration. The available post-mortem findings indicate these imaging-related changes are accompanied by reductions in neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic density, as well as increased afferent input, suggesting the grey matter differences observed with MRI arise from alterations in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissue compartments. We discuss the potential mechanisms that might facilitate integration of these findings and consider strategies for future research.},

It has been implicated in a diversity of functions, from reward processing and performance monitoring to the execution of control and action selection. Here, we propose that this diversity can be understood in terms of a single underlying function: allocation of control based on an evaluation of the expected value of control (EVC). We present a normative model of EVC that integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process, the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost in terms of cognitive effort. We propose that dACC integrates this information, using it to determine whether, where and how much control to allocate. We then consider how the EVC model can explain the diverse array of findings concerning dACC function},

The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention "oddball" task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity studies with fMRI showed that the brain is intrinsically organized into large-scale functional networks for which the hemodynamic signature is stable for about 10. s. Spatial analyses of the topography of the spontaneous EEG also show discrete epochs of stable global brain states (so-called microstates), but they remain quasi-stationary for only about 100. ms. In order to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states, we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with the hemodynamic response function allowed to fit a linear model to the fMRI BOLD responses and revealed four distinct distributed networks. These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention reorientation, and subjective interoceptive-autonomic processing. We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the four typical microstates of the spontaneous EEG seem to represent the neurophysiological correlate of four of the RSNs and show that they are fluctuating much more rapidly than fMRI alone suggests. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background The main focus of studies of individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR) has been on identifying brain changes in those individuals who will develop psychosis. However, longitudinal studies have shown that up to half of UHR individuals are resilient, with symptomatic remission and good functioning at follow-up. Yet little is known about brain development in resilient individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate differences in brain development between resilient and non-resilient individuals. Methods A six-year longitudinal structural MRI study was performed with up to three scans per individual. The final sample consisted of 48 UHR individuals and 48 typically developing controls with a total of 225 MRI-scans, aged 12???20??years at the time of the first MRI-scan and matched for age, gender and number of follow-up scans. At six-year follow-up, 35 UHR individuals were divided in resilient (good functional outcome) and non-resilient (poor functional outcome) subgroups, defined by the modified Global Assessment of Functioning. The main outcome measures were developmental changes in MR-based measures of cortical and subcortical anatomy. Results We found widespread differences in volume of frontal, temporal and parietal cortex between resilient and non-resilient individuals. These were already present at baseline and remained stable over development (12???24??years). Furthermore, there were differences in the development of cortical surface area in frontal regions including cingulate gyrus. Conclusions Developmental differences may reflect compensatory neural mechanisms, where better functioning in resilient individuals leads to less tissue loss over development.},

However, the etiology of this disorder has yet to be fully understood. Recent findings suggest that alteration of the basic sense of self-awareness may be an essential distortion of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In addition, extensive research of social and mentalizing abilities has stressed the role of distortion of social skills in schizophrenia.This article aims to propose and support a concept of a triple brain network model of the dysfunctional switching between default mode and central executive network (CEN) related to the aberrant activity of the salience network. This model could represent a unitary mechanism of a wide array of symptom domains present in schizophrenia including the deficit of self (self-awareness and self-representation) and theory of mind (ToM) dysfunctions along with the traditional positive, negative and cognitive domains. We review previous studies which document the dysfunctions of self and ToM in schizophrenia together with neuroimaging data that support the triple brain network model as a common neuronal substrate of this dysfunction.},

abstract = {Recently, a great deal of interest has arisen in resting state fMRI as a measure of tonic brain function in clinical populations. Most studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlation between resting state fMRI low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). Studies on the amplitudes of these low-frequency oscillations are rarely reported. Here, we used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF; the relative amplitude that resides in the low frequencies) to examine the amplitude of LFO in schizophrenia. Twenty-six healthy controls and 29 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated. Our findings show that patients showed reduced low-frequency amplitude in proportion to the total frequency band investigated (i.e., fALFF) in the lingual gyrus, left cuneus, left insula/superior temporal gyrus, and right caudate and increased fALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus. ALFF was reduced in patients in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, and precuneus and increased in the left parahippocampal gyrus. These results suggest LFO abnormalities in schizophrenia. The implication of these abnormalities for schizophrenic symptomatology is further discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Complexity estimators have been broadly utilized in schizophrenia investigation. Early studies reported increased complexity in schizophrenia patients, associated with a higher variability or "irregularity" of their brain signals. However, further investigations showed reduced complexities, thus introducing a clear divergence. Nowadays, both increased and reduced complexity values are reported. The explanation of such divergence is a critical issue to understand the role of complexity measures in schizophrenia research. Considering previous arguments a complementary hypothesis is advanced: if the increased irregularity of schizophrenia patients' neurophysiological activity is assumed, a "natural" tendency to increased complexity in EEG and MEG scans should be expected, probably reflecting an abnormal neuronal firing pattern in some critical regions such as the frontal lobes. This "natural" tendency to increased complexity might be modulated by the interaction of three main factors: medication effects, symptomatology, and age effects. Therefore, young, medication-na{\"{i}}ve, and highly symptomatic (positive symptoms) patients are expected to exhibit increased complexities. More importantly, the investigation of these interacting factors by means of complexity estimators might help to elucidate some of the neuropathological processes involved in schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Fluctuations in endogenous cortical activity occur at multiple time scales and index a dynamic repertoire of network states that are continuously explored, even in the absence of external sensory inputs. Here, we quantified such moment-to-moment brain signal variability at rest in a large, cross-sectional sample of children ranging in age from seven to eleven years. Our findings revealed a monotonic rise in the complexity of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as measured by sample entropy, from the youngest to the oldest age cohort, across a range of time scales and spatial regions. From year to year, the greatest changes in intraindividual brain signal variability were recorded at electrodes covering the anterior cortical zones. These results provide converging evidence concerning the age-dependent expansion of functional cortical network states during a critical developmental period ranging from early to late childhood.},

abstract = {Two hypotheses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) propose that this condition is characterized by deficits in Theory of Mind and by hypoconnectivity between remote cortical regions with hyperconnectivity locally. The default mode network (DMN) is a set of remote, functionally connected cortical nodes less active during executive tasks than at rest and is implicated in Theory of Mind, episodic memory, and other self-reflective processes. We show that children with ASD have reduced connectivity between DMN nodes and increased local connectivity within DMN nodes and the visual and motor resting-state networks. We show that, like the trajectory of synaptogenesis, internodal DMN functional connectivity increased as a quadratic function of age in typically developing children, peaking between, 11 and 13 years. In children with ASD, these long-distance connections fail to develop during adolescence. These findings support the "developmental disconnection model" of ASD, provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the Theory-of-Mind hypothesis of ASD, and show that the window for effectively treating ASD could be wider than previously thought.},

abstract = {Functional brain networks demonstrate significant temporal variability and dynamic reconfiguration even in the resting state. Currently, most studies investigate temporal variability of brain networks at the scale of single (micro) or whole-brain (macro) connectivity. However, the mechanism underlying time-varying properties remains unclear, as the coupling between brain network variability and neural activity is not readily apparent when analysed at either micro or macroscales. We propose an intermediate (meso) scale analysis and characterize temporal variability of the functional architecture associated with a particular region. This yields a topography of variability that reflects the whole-brain and, most importantly, creates an analytical framework to establish the fundamental relationship between variability of regional functional architecture and its neural activity or structural connectivity. We find that temporal variability reflects the dynamical reconfiguration of a brain region into distinct functional modules at different times and may be indicative of brain flexibility and adaptability. Primary and unimodal sensory-motor cortices demonstrate low temporal variability, while transmodal areas, including heteromodal association areas and limbic system, demonstrate the high variability. In particular, regions with highest variability such as hippocampus/parahippocampus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, olfactory gyrus and caudate are all related to learning, suggesting that the temporal variability may indicate the level of brain adaptability. With simultaneously recorded electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging/diffusion tensor imaging data, we also find that variability of regional functional architecture is modulated by local blood oxygen level-dependent activity and a-band oscillation, and is governed by the ratio of intra- to inter-community structural connectivity. Application of the mesoscale variability measure to multicentre datasets of three mental disorders and matched controls involving 1180 subjects reveals that those regions demonstrating extreme, i.e. highest/lowest variability in controls are most liable to change in mental disorders. Specifically, we draw attention to the identification of diametrically opposing patterns of variability changes between schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/autism. Regions of the default-mode network demonstrate lower variability in patients with schizophrenia, but high variability in patients with autism/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, compared with respective controls. In contrast, subcortical regions, especially the thalamus, show higher variability in schizophrenia patients, but lower variability in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The changes in variability of these regions are also closely related to symptom scores. Our work provides insights into the dynamic organization of the resting brain and how it changes in brain disorders. The nodal variability measure may also be potentially useful as a predictor for learning and neural rehabilitation.},

This neurobiological account is based on the central role played by neuronal plasticity in shaping the connections and the ensuing dynamics that underlie brain function. The particular hypothesis put forward here is that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is expressed at the level of modulation of associative changes in synaptic efficacy; specifically the modulation of plasticity in those brain systems responsible for emotional learning and memory, in the post-natal period. This modulation is mediated by ascending neurotransmitter systems that: (i) have been implicated in schizophrenia; and (ii) are known to be involved in consolidating synaptic connections during learning. The proposed pathophysiology would translate, in functional terms, into a disruption of the reinforcement of adaptive behaviour that is consistent with the disintegrative aspects of schizophrenic neuropsychology.},

abstract = {Two aspects of the low frequency fluctuations of spontaneous brain activity have been proposed which reflect the complex and dynamic features of resting-state activity, namely temporal variability and signal synchronization. The relationship between them, especially its role in consciousness, nevertheless remains unclear. Our study examined the temporal variability and signal synchronization of spontaneous brain activity, as well as their relationship during loss of consciousness. We applied an intra-subject design of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in two conditions: during wakefulness, and under anesthesia with clinical unconsciousness. In addition, an independent group of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) was included in order to test the reliability of our findings. We observed a global reduction in the temporal variability, local and distant brain signal synchronization for subjects during anesthesia. Importantly, we found a link between temporal variability and both local and distant signal synchronizations during wakefulness: the higher the degree of temporal variability, the higher its intra-regional homogeneity and inter-regional functional connectivity. In contrast, this link was broken down under anesthesia, implying a decoupling between temporal variability and signal synchronization; this decoupling was reproduced in patients with DOC. Our results suggest that there exist some as yet unclear physiological mechanisms of consciousness which "couple" the two mathematically independent measures, temporal variability and signal synchronization of spontaneous brain activity. Our findings not only extend our current knowledge of the neural correlates of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, but have implications for both computational neural modeling and clinical practice, such as in the diagnosis of loss of consciousness in patients with DOC.},

abstract = {Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis is a novel entropy-based approach for measuring dynamical complexity in physiological systems over a range of temporal scales. To evaluate this analytic approach as an aid to elucidating the pathophysiologic mechanisms in schizophrenia, we examined MSE in EEG activity in drug-naive schizophrenia subjects pre- and post-treatment with antipsychotics in comparison with traditional EEG analysis. We recorded eyes-closed resting-state EEG from frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in drug-naive 22 schizophrenia and 24 age-matched healthy control subjects. Fifteen patients were re-evaluated within 2-8weeks after the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. For each participant, MSE was calculated on one continuous 60-s epoch for each experimental session. Schizophrenia subjects showed significantly higher complexity at higher time scales (lower frequencies) than did healthy controls in fronto-centro-temporal, but not in parieto-occipital regions. Post-treatment, this higher complexity decreased to healthy control subject levels selectively in fronto-central regions, while the increased complexity in temporal sites remained higher. Comparative power analysis identified spectral slowing in frontal regions in pre-treatment schizophrenia subjects, consistent with previous findings, whereas no antipsychotic treatment effect was observed. In summary, multiscale entropy measures identified abnormal dynamical EEG signal complexity in anterior brain areas in schizophrenia that normalized selectively in fronto-central areas with antipsychotic treatment. These findings show that entropy-based analytic methods may serve as a novel approach for characterizing and understanding abnormal cortical dynamics in schizophrenia and elucidating the therapeutic mechanisms of antipsychotics. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent reports of functional and anatomical studies have provided evidence that aberrant neural connectivity lies at the heart of many mental disorders. Information related to neural networks has elucidated the nonlinear dynamical complexity in brain signals over a range of temporal scales. The recent advent of nonlinear analytic methods, which have served for the quantitative description of the brain signal complexity, has provided new insights into aberrant neural connectivity in many mental disorders. Although many studies have underpinned aberrant neural connectivity, findings related to complexity behavior are still inconsistent. This inconsistency might result from (i) heterogeneity in mental disorders, (ii) analytical issues, (iii) interference of typical development and aging. First, most mental disorders are heterogeneous in their clinical feature or intrinsic pathological mechanisms. Second, neurophysiologic output signals from complex brain connectivity might be characterized with multiple time scales or frequencies. Finally, age-related brain complexity changes must be considered when investigating pathological brain because typical brain complexity is not constant across generations. Future systematic studies addressing these issues will greatly expand our knowledge of neural connections and dynamics related to mental disorders. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this article we review both structural and functional neuroimaging studies of patients with auditory and visual hallucinations as well as a small number of studies that have assessed cognitive processes associated with hallucinations in healthy volunteers. The current literature suggests that in addition to secondary (and occasionally primary) sensory cortices, dysfunction in prefrontal premotor, cingulate, subcortical and cerebellar regions also seem to contribute to hallucinatory experiences.

abstract = {? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Large-scale brain networks play a prominent role in cognitive abilities and their activity is impaired in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at high risk of developing schizophrenia and present similar cognitive impairments, including executive functions deficits. Thus, 22q11DS represents a model for the study of neural biomarkers associated with schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated structural and functional connectivity within and between the Default Mode (DMN), the Central Executive (CEN), and the Saliency network (SN) in 22q11DS using resting-state fMRI and DTI. Furthermore, we investigated if triple network impairments were related to executive dysfunctions or the presence of psychotic symptoms. Sixty-three patients with 22q11DS and sixty-eighty controls (age 6-33 years) were included in the study. Structural connectivity between main nodes of DMN, CEN, and SN was computed using probabilistic tractography. Functional connectivity was computed as the partial correlation between the time courses extracted from each node. Structural and functional connectivity measures were then correlated to executive functions and psychotic symptom scores. Our results showed mainly reduced structural connectivity within the CEN, DMN, and SN, in patients with 22q11DS compared with controls as well as reduced between-network connectivity. Functional connectivity appeared to be more preserved, with impairments being evident only within the DMN. Structural connectivity impairments were also related to executive dysfunctions. These findings show an association between triple network structural alterations and executive deficits in patients with the microdeletion, suggesting that 22q11DS and schizophrenia share common psychopathological mechanisms.},

abstract = {Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a part of the brain's limbic system. Classically, this region has been related to affect, on the basis of lesion studies in humans and in animals. In the late 1980s, neuroimaging research indicated that ACC was active in many studies of cognition. The findings from EEG studies of a focal area of negativity in scalp electrodes following an error response led to the idea that ACC might be the brain's error detection and correction device. In this article, these various findings are reviewed in relation to the idea that ACC is a part of a circuit involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing. Neuroimaging studies showing that separate areas of ACC are involved in cognition and emotion are discussed and related to results showing that the error negativity is influenced by affect and motivation. In addition, the development of the emotional and cognitive roles of ACC are discussed, and how the success of this regulation in controlling responses might be correlated with cingulate size. Finally, some theories are considered about how the different subdivisions of ACC might interact with other cortical structures as a part of the circuits involved in the regulation of mental and emotional activity},

abstract = {The investigation of self-reflective processing during adolescence is relevant, as this period is characterized by deep reorganization of the self-concept. It may be the case that an atypical development of brain regions underlying self-reflective processing increases the risk for psychological disorders and impaired social functioning. In this study, we investigated the neural bases of self- and other-related processing in typically developing adolescents and youths with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a rare neurogenetic condition associated with difficulties in social interactions and increased risk for schizophrenia. The fMRI paradigm consisted in judging if a series of adjectives applied to the participant himself/herself (self), to his/her best friend or to a fictional character (Harry Potter). In control adolescents, we observed that self- and other-related processing elicited strong activation in cortical midline structures (CMS) when contrasted with a semantic baseline condition. 22q11DS exhibited hypoactivation in the CMS and the striatum during the processing of self-related information when compared to the control group. Finally, the hypoactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex was associated with the severity of prodromal positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The findings are discussed in a developmental framework and in light of their implication for the development of schizophrenia in this at-risk population. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Since initial reports regarding the impact of motion artifact on measures of functional connectivity, there has been a proliferation of confound regression methods to limit its impact. However, recent techniques have not been systematically evaluated using consistent outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 12 commonly used confound regression methods in 193 young adults. Specifically, we compare methods according to three benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but unmask distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of proposed methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.},

abstract = {Blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) has rapidly become a popular technique for the investigation of brain function in healthy individuals, patients as well as in animal studies. However, the BOLD signal arises from a complex mixture of neuronal, metabolic and vascular processes, being therefore an indirect measure of neuronal activity, which is further severely corrupted by multiple non-neuronal fluctuations of instrumental, physiological or subject-specific origin. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing methods for cleaning the BOLD fMRI signal. The description is given from a methodological point of view, focusing on the operation of the different techniques in addition to pointing out the advantages and limitations in their application. Since motion-related and physiological noise fluctuations are two of the main noise components of the signal, techniques targeting their removal are primarily addressed, including both data-driven approaches and using external recordings. Data-driven approaches, which are less specific in the assumed model and can simultaneously reduce multiple noise fluctuations, are mainly based on data decomposition techniques such as principal and independent component analysis. Importantly, the usefulness of strategies that benefit from the information available in the phase component of the signal, or in multiple signal echoes is also highlighted. The use of global signal regression for denoising is also addressed. Finally, practical recommendations regarding the optimization of the preprocessing pipeline for the purpose of denoising and future venues of research are indicated. Through the review, we summarize the importance of signal denoising as an essential step in the analysis pipeline of task-based and resting state fMRI studies.},

@article{Zoller2017,
abstract = {Although often ignored in fMRI studies, moment-to-moment variability of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals reveals important information about brain function. Indeed, higher brain signal variability has been associated with better cognitive performance in young adults compared to children and elderly adults. Functional connectivity, a very common approach in resting-state fMRI analysis, is scaled for variance. Thus, alterations might be confounded or driven by BOLD signal variance alterations. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with a vast cognitive and clinical phenotype. To date, several resting-state fMRI studies reported altered functional connectivity in 22q11.2DS, however BOLD signal variance has not yet been analyzed. Here, we employed PLS correlation analysis to reveal multivariate patterns of diagnosis-related alterations and age-relationship throughout the cortex of 50 patients between 9 and 25 years old and 50 healthy controls in the same age range. To address how functional connectivity in the default mode network is influenced by BOLD signal fluctuations, we conducted the same analysis on seed-to-voxel connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and compared resulting brain patterns. BOLD signal variance was lower mainly in regions of the default mode network and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but higher in large parts of the temporal lobes. In those regions, BOLD signal variance was correlated with age in healthy controls, but not in patients, suggesting deviant developmental trajectories from child- to adulthood. Positive connectivity of the PCC within the default mode network as well as negative connectivity towards the frontoparietal network were weaker in patients with 22q11.2DS. We furthermore showed that lower functional connectivity of the PCC was not driven by higher BOLD signal variability. Our results confirm the strong implication of BOLD variance in aging and give an initial insight in its relationship with functional connectivity in the DMN.},

abstract = {Despite a lack of recent progress in the treatment of schizophrenia, our understanding of its genetic and environmental causes has considerably improved, and their relationship to aberrant patterns of neurodevelopment has become clearer. This raises the possibility that 'disease-modifying' strategies could alter the course to - and of - this debilitating disorder, rather than simply alleviating symptoms. A promising window for course-altering intervention is around the time of the first episode of psychosis, especially in young people at risk of transition to schizophrenia. Indeed, studies performed in both individuals at risk of developing schizophrenia and rodent models for schizophrenia suggest that pre-diagnostic pharmacotherapy and psychosocial or cognitive-behavioural interventions can delay or moderate the emergence of psychosis. Of particular interest are 'hybrid' strategies that both relieve presenting symptoms and reduce the risk of transition to schizophrenia or another psychiatric disorder. This Review aims to provide a broad-based consideration of the challenges and opportunities inherent in efforts to alter the course of schizophrenia.},

Following a complete description of the theory involved, a simple example is used to illustrate jack-knifing of bilinear PLSR parameters, using data obtained for variables (sensory and formulatory) in mixtures of cocoa, sugar and milk powder in water. The relatively simple validity criterion of jack-knife perturbation, combined with graphical interpretation, appeared to improve the safety of PLSR as a framework for multivariate data analysis of food quality and preference data.

abstract = {That the left prefrontal cortex has a critical role setting response criteria for numerous tasks has been well established, but gaps remain in our understanding of the brain mechanisms of task-setting. We aimed at (i) testing the involvement of this region in setting the criteria for a non-response and (ii) assessing functional connectivity between this and other brain regions involved in task-setting. Fourteen young participants performed a go/nogo task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task included two nogo visual stimuli which elicit a high (distractor) or a low (other) tendency to respond, respectively. Two task blocks were examined to assess learning the criteria. First, a multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis identified brain regions that co-varied with task conditions, as expressed by two significant Latent Variables (LVs). One LV distinguished go and nogo stimuli. The other LV identified regions involved in the first block when the criteria not to respond to distractors were established. The left prefrontal region was prominently involved. Second, a left ventrolateral prefrontal area was selected from this LV as a seed region to perform functional connectivity using a multi-block PLS analysis. Results showed a distributed network functionally connected with the seed, including superior medial prefrontal and left superior parietal regions. These findings extend our understanding of task-setting along the following dimensions: 1) even when a task requires withholding a response, the left prefrontal cortex has a critical role in setting criteria, and 2) this region responds to the task demands within a distinctive functional network. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this article, we introduce a multimodal multivariate network analysis to characterize the linkage between the patterns of information from the same individual's complementary brain images, and illustrate its potential by showing its ability to distinguish older from younger adults with greater power than several previously established methods. Our proposed method uses measurements from every brain voxel in each person's complementary co-registered images and uses the partial least square (PLS) algorithm to form a combined latent variable that maximizes the covariance among all of the combined variables. It represents a new way to calculate the singular value decomposition from the high-dimensional covariance matrix in a computationally feasible way. Analyzing fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, this method distinguished 14 older adults from 15 younger adults (p = 4e- 12) with no overlap between groups, no need to correct for multiple comparisons, and greater power than the univariate Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), multimodal SPM or multivariate PLS analysis of either imaging modality alone. This technique has the potential to link patterns of information among any number of complementary images from an individual, to use other kinds of complementary complex datasets besides brain images, and to characterize individual state- or trait-dependent brain patterns in a more powerful way. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In proactive interference (PI) paradigms, previous learning impairs the acquisition of new, related information. In rats, efficient resolution of PI relies on cholinergic modulation from the basal forebrain (BF). To test whether humans resolve PI using a functional network dependent on the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB) nuclei of the BF, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging signal recorded while human participants learned to respond to baseline color paired associates and then additional pairs that interfered with the baseline pairs. Multivariate, partial least-squares analysis supported a MS/DB-dependent functional network: MS/DB activity covaried with activity in areas important to selective attention, including intraparietal sulcus, and memory that are direct cholinergic efferents of the MS/DB, including the hippocampus, as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, implicated in PI resolution. This network was associated with effective PI-resolution behavior. A second network also correlated with PI resolution but appearing not to be driven by the MS/DB, included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with compromised BF function did not engage the MS/DB-dependent network reliably; instead their PI-resolution behavior was well explained by the second network. Thus, 2 functional networks may underly a single cognitive function; when the MS/DB-dependent attention/memory integration network is compromised, an alternate network is available to maintain normal levels of performance.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent cohorts were included in this study: Group 1 (82 healthy subjects aged 18-28 years) and Group 2 (109 healthy subjects aged 20-28 years). Structural MRI data were acquired at 3.0T and 1.5T using a magnetization prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo sequence for these two groups, respectively. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) to construct SCNs and further applied the spatial overlap ratio and correlation coefficient to evaluate the spatial consistency of the SCNs between these two datasets. RESULTS: Seven and six independent components were identified for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Moreover, six SCNs including the posterior default mode network, the visual and auditory networks consistently existed across the two datasets. The overlap ratios and correlation coefficients of the visual network reached the maximums of 72{\%} and 0.71. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the existence of consistent SCNs corresponding to general functional networks. These structural covariance findings may provide insight into the underlying organizational principles of brain anatomy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the use of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) for the analysis of structural neuroimaging data. The goal is to identify the brain regions that co-vary across individuals in a consistent way, hence potentially being part of underlying brain networks or otherwise influenced by underlying common mechanisms such as genetics and pathologies. NNMF offers a directly data-driven way of extracting relatively localized co-varying structural regions, thereby transcending limitations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and other related methods that tend to produce dispersed components of positive and negative loadings. In particular, leveraging upon the well known ability of NNMF to produce parts-based representations of image data, we derive decompositions that partition the brain into regions that vary in consistent ways across individuals. Importantly, these decompositions achieve dimensionality reduction via highly interpretable ways and generalize well to new data as shown via split-sample experiments. We empirically validate NNMF in two data sets: i) a Diffusion Tensor (DT) mouse brain development study, and ii) a structural Magnetic Resonance (sMR) study of human brain aging. We demonstrate the ability of NNMF to produce sparse parts-based representations of the data at various resolutions. These representations seem to follow what we know about the underlying functional organization of the brain and also capture some pathological processes. Moreover, we show that these low dimensional representations favorably compare to descriptions obtained with more commonly used matrix factorization methods like PCA and ICA.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance data acquired in a task-absent condition ("resting state") require new data analysis techniques that do not depend on an activation model. In this work, we introduce an alternative assumption- and parameter-free method based on a particular form of node centrality called eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality attributes a value to each voxel in the brain such that a voxel receives a large value if it is strongly correlated with many other nodes that are themselves central within the network. Google's PageRank algorithm is a variant of eigenvector centrality. Thus far, other centrality measures - in particular "betweenness centrality" - have been applied to fMRI data using a pre-selected set of nodes consisting of several hundred elements. Eigenvector centrality is computationally much more efficient than betweenness centrality and does not require thresholding of similarity values so that it can be applied to thousands of voxels in a region of interest covering the entire cerebrum which would have been infeasible using betweenness centrality. Eigenvector centrality can be used on a variety of different similarity metrics. Here, we present applications based on linear correlations and on spectral coherences between fMRI times series. This latter approach allows us to draw conclusions of connectivity patterns in different spectral bands. We apply this method to fMRI data in task-absent conditions where subjects were in states of hunger or satiety. We show that eigenvector centrality is modulated by the state that the subjects were in. Our analyses demonstrate that eigenvector centrality is a computationally efficient tool for capturing intrinsic neural architecture on a voxel-wise level.},

abstract = {Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) has recently emerged as a measure to spatially characterize connectivity in functional brain imaging by attributing network properties to voxels. The main obstacle for widespread use of ECM in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the cost of computing and storing the connectivity matrix. This article presents fast ECM (fECM), an efficient algorithm to estimate voxel-wise eigenvector centralities from fMRI time series. Instead of explicitly storing the connectivity matrix, fECM computes matrix-vector products directly from the data, achieving high accelerations for computing voxel-wise centralities in fMRI at standard resolutions for multivariate analyses, and enabling high-resolution analyses performed on standard hardware. We demonstrate the validity of fECM at cluster and voxel levels, using synthetic and in vivo data. Results from synthetic data are compared to the theoretical gold standard, and local centrality changes in fMRI data are measured after experimental intervention. A simple scheme is presented to generate time series with prescribed covariances that represent a connectivity matrix. These time series are used to construct a 4D dataset whose volumes consist of separate regions with known intra- and inter-regional connectivities. The fECM method is tested and validated on these synthetic data. Resting-state fMRI data acquired after real-versus-sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation show fECM connectivity changes in resting-state network regions. A comparison of analyses with and without accounting for motion parameters demonstrates a moderate effect of these parameters on the centrality estimates. Its computational speed and statistical sensitivity make fECM a good candidate for connectivity analyses of multimodality and high-resolution functional neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {A similar pattern of deficits in executive function and neuroanatomical abnormalities is shared between 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) and schizophrenia, suggesting that common cerebral alterations may lead to cognitive dysfunction and promote the appearance of psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS individuals. Specifically, there is increasing evidence for involvement of the cingulate gyrus (CG) in executive dysfunction and the expression of positive symptoms in schizophrenia. The aim of our study is to examine CG morphology in a 22q11DS population and its potential role as a cerebral marker of executive dysfunction and the manifestation of psychotic symptoms. Using region of interest (ROI)-based analysis, we compared CG volumes from 58 children and adults affected by 22q11DS with 64 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. After covarying for total cranium grey matter and age, a bilateral reduced CG grey matter volume, driven by a decrease in anterior CG cortex, was observed among 22q11DS patients. Further post hoc analyses suggest correlations between right CG cortical reductions, low-executive functioning and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms. The CG structural abnormalities observed in 22q11DS are consistent with previous reports in schizophrenic patients and are associated with pre-morbid cognitive impairments. The mechanisms by which these changes may modulate executive functioning and the expression of psychosis are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by functional dysconnectivity or abnormal integration between distant brain regions. Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical-subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Recently, fMRI researchers have begun to realize that the brain's intrinsic network patterns may undergo substantial changes during a single resting state (RS) scan. However, despite the growing interest in brain dynamics, metrics that can quantify the variability of network patterns are still quite limited. Here, we first introduce various quantification metrics based on the extension of co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis, a recently proposed point-process analysis that tracks state alternations at each individual time frame and relies on very few assumptions; then apply these proposed metrics to quantify changes of brain dynamics during a sustained 2-back working memory (WM) task compared to rest. We focus on the functional connectivity of two prominent RS networks, the default-mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). We first demonstrate less variability of global Pearson correlations with respect to the two chosen networks using a sliding-window approach during WM task compared to rest; then we show that the macroscopic decrease in variations in correlations during a WM task is also well characterized by the combined effect of a reduced number of dominant CAPs, increased spatial consistency across CAPs, and increased fractional contributions of a few dominant CAPs. These CAP metrics may provide alternative and more straightforward quantitative means of characterizing brain network dynamics than time-windowed correlation analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have been shown that functional connectivity of cerebral areas is not a static phenomenon, but exhibits spontaneous fluctuations over time. There is evidence that fluctuating connectivity is an intrinsic phenomenon of brain dynamics that persists during anesthesia. Lately, point process analysis applied on functional data has revealed that much of the information regarding brain connectivity is contained in a fraction of critical time points of a resting state dataset. In the present study we want to extend this methodology for the investigation of resting state fMRI spatial pattern changes during propofol-induced modulation of consciousness, with the aim of extracting new insights on brain networks consciousness-dependent fluctuations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Resting-state fMRI volumes on 18 healthy subjects were acquired in four clinical states during propofol injection: wakefulness, sedation, unconsciousness, and recovery. The dataset was reduced to a spatio-temporal point process by selecting time points in the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) at which the signal is higher than a given threshold (i.e., BOLD intensity above 1 standard deviation). Spatial clustering on the PCC time frames extracted was then performed (number of clusters = 8), to obtain 8 different PCC co-activation patterns (CAPs) for each level of consciousness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The current analysis shows that the core of the PCC-CAPs throughout consciousness modulation seems to be preserved. Nonetheless, this methodology enables to differentiate region-specific propofol-induced reductions in PCC-CAPs, some of them already present in the functional connectivity literature (e.g., disconnections of the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, auditory cortex), some others new (e.g., reduced co-activation in motor cortex and visual area).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results indicate that the employed methodology can help in improving and refining the characterization of local functional changes in the brain associated to propofol-induced modulation of consciousness.},

abstract = {Depression is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that is diagnosed when a patient reports at least five of nine symptoms. This allows for several hundred unique combinations of changes in mood, appetite, sleep, energy, cognition and motor activity. Such remarkable heteroge-neity reflects the consensus view that there are multiple forms of depres-sion, but their neurobiological basis remains poorly understood 1,2 . So far, most efforts to characterize depression subtypes and develop diagnostic biomarkers have begun by identifying clusters of symptoms that tend to co-occur, and by then testing for neurophysiological cor-relates. These pioneering studies have defined atypical, melancholic, seasonal and agitated subtypes of depression associated with charac-teristic changes in neuroendocrine activity, circadian rhythms and other potential biomarkers 3–5 . Still, the association between clinical subtypes and their biological substrates is inconsistent and variable at the individual level, and unlike diagnostic biomarkers in other areas of medicine, they have not yet proven useful for differentiating individual patients from healthy controls or for reliably predicting treatment response at the individual level. An alternative to subtyping patients on the basis of co-occurring clinical symptoms is to identify neurophysiological subtypes, or biotypes, by clustering subjects according to shared signatures of brain dysfunction 6 . This type of approach has already begun to yield insights into how differing biological mechanisms may give rise to overlapping, heterogeneous clinical presentations of psy-chotic disorders 6,7 . Neuroimaging biomarkers of abnormal brain function have proven utility in the assessment of pain 8 and have also shown promise for depression, for both the prediction of treatment response 9–13 and treatment selection 14 . Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) is an especially useful modality because it can be used easily in diverse patient populations to quantify functional network connec-tivity in terms of correlated, spontaneous MR signal fluctuations. Depression is associated with dysfunction and abnormal functional connectivity in frontostriatal and limbic brain networks 15–20 , in accordance with morphological and synaptic changes in chronic stress models in rodents 21–24 . These studies raise the intriguing possibility that fMRI measures of connectivity could be leveraged to identify},

abstract = {The number of resting state functional connectivity MRI studies continues to expand at a rapid rate along with the options for data processing. Of the processing options, few have generated as much controversy as global signal regression and the subsequent observation of negative correlations (anti-correlations). This debate has motivated new processing strategies and advancement in the field, but has also generated significant confusion and contradictory guidelines. In this article, we work towards a consensus regarding global signal regression. We highlight several points of agreement including the fact that there is not a single "right" way to process resting state data that reveals the "true" nature of the brain. Although further work is needed, different processing approaches likely reveal complementary insights about the brain's functional organisation.},

We show that in a finite-sized cortical attractor network, this can be an advantage, for it leads to probabilistic behavior that is advantageous in decision-making, by preventing deadlock, and is important in signal detectability. We show how computations can be performed through stochastic dynamical effects, including the role of noise in enabling probabilistic jumping across barriers in the energy landscape describing the flow of the dynamics in attractor networks. The results obtained in neurophysiological studies of decision-making and signal detectability are modelled by the stochastical neurodynamics of integrate-and-fire networks of neurons with probabilistic neuronal spiking. We describe how these stochastic neurodynamical effects can be analyzed, and their importance in many aspects of brain function, including decision-making, memory recall, short-term memory, and attention. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Large-scale covariance of cortical thickness or volume in distributed brain regions has been consistently reported by human neuroimaging studies. The mechanism of this population covariance of regional cortical anatomy has been hypothetically related to synchronized maturational changes in anatomically connected neuronal populations. Brain regions that grow together, i.e., increase or decrease in volume at the same rate over the course of years in the same individual, are thus expected to demonstrate strong structural covariance or anatomical connectivity across individuals. To test this prediction, we used a structural MRI dataset on healthy young people (N = 108; aged 9-22 years at enrollment), comprising 3-6 longitudinal scans on each participant over 6-12 years of follow-up. At each of 360 regional nodes, and for each participant, we estimated the following: (1) the cortical thickness in the median scan and (2) the linear rate of change in cortical thickness over years of serial scanning. We constructed structural and maturational association matrices and networks from these measurements. Both structural and maturational networks shared similar global and nodal topological properties, as well as mesoscopic features including a modular community structure, a relatively small number of highly connected hub regions, and a bias toward short distance connections. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a subset of the sample (N = 32), we also demonstrated that functional connectivity and network organization was somewhat predictable by structural/maturational networks but demonstrated a stronger bias toward short distance connections and greater topological segregation. Brain structural covariance networks are likely to reflect synchronized developmental change in distributed cortical regions.},

@article{Cole2016,
abstract = {Background: An increasing number of neuroscientific studies gain insights by focusing on differences in functional connectivity-between groups, individuals, temporal windows, or task conditions. We found using simulations that additional insights into such differences can be gained by forgoing variance normalization, a procedure used by most functional connectivity measures. Simulations indicated that these functional connectivity measures are sensitive to increases in independent fluctuations (unshared signal) in time series, consistently reducing functional connectivity estimates (e.g., correlations) even though such changes are unrelated to corresponding fluctuations (shared signal) between those time series. This is inconsistent with the common notion of functional connectivity as the amount of inter-region interaction. New method: Simulations revealed that a version of correlation without variance normalization - covariance - was able to isolate differences in shared signal, increasing interpretability of observed functional connectivity change. Simulations also revealed cases problematic for non-normalized methods, leading to a "covariance conjunction" method combining the benefits of both normalized and non-normalized approaches. Results: We found that covariance and covariance conjunction methods can detect functional connectivity changes across a variety of tasks and rest in both clinical and non-clinical functional MRI datasets. Comparison with existing method(s): We verified using a variety of tasks and rest in both clinical and non-clinical functional MRI datasets that it matters in practice whether correlation, covariance, or covariance conjunction methods are used. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the practical and theoretical utility of isolating changes in shared signal, improving the ability to interpret observed functional connectivity change.},

abstract = {Cognitive skills undergo protracted developmental changes resulting in proficiencies that are a hallmark of human cognition. One skill that develops over time is the ability to problem solve, which in turn relies on cognitive control and attention abilities. Here we use a novel multimodal neurocognitive network-based approach combining task-related fMRI, resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the maturation of control processes underlying problem solving skills in 7-9 year-old children. Our analysis focused on two key neurocognitive networks implicated in a wide range of cognitive tasks including control: the insula-cingulate salience network, anchored in anterior insula (AI), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, and the fronto-parietal central executive network, anchored in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We found that, by age 9, the AI node of the salience network is a major causal hub initiating control signals during problem solving. Critically, despite stronger AI activation, the strength of causal regulatory influences from AI to the PPC node of the central executive network was significantly weaker and contributed to lower levels of behavioral performance in children compared to adults. These results were validated using two different analytic methods for estimating causal interactions in fMRI data. In parallel, DTI-based tractography revealed weaker AI-PPC structural connectivity in children. Our findings point to a crucial role of AI connectivity, and its causal cross-network influences, in the maturation of dynamic top-down control signals underlying cognitive development. Overall, our study demonstrates how a unified neurocognitive network model when combined with multimodal imaging enhances our ability to generalize beyond individual task-activated foci and provides a common framework for elucidating key features of brain and cognitive development. The quantitative approach developed is likely to be useful in investigating neurodevelopmental disorders, in which control processes are impaired, such as autism and ADHD.},

abstract = {Multivariate pattern recognition approaches have recently facilitated the search for reliable neuroimaging-based biomarkers in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. By taking into account the multivariate nature of brain functional and structural changes as well as their distributed localization across the whole brain, they overcome drawbacks of traditional univariate approaches. To evaluate the overall reliability of neuroimaging-based biomarkers, we conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify all studies that used multivariate pattern recognition to identify patterns of brain alterations that differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. A bivariate random-effects meta-analytic model was implemented to investigate the sensitivity and specificity across studies as well as to assess the robustness to potentially confounding variables. In the total sample of n=38 studies (1602 patients and 1637 healthy controls), patients were differentiated from controls with a sensitivity of 80.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 76.7-83.5{\%}) and a specificity of 80.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 76.9-83.3{\%}). Analysis of neuroimaging modality indicated higher sensitivity (84.46{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 79.9-88.2{\%}) and similar specificity (76.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 71.3-81.6{\%}) of rsfMRI studies as compared with structural MRI studies (sensitivity: 76.4{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 71.9-80.4{\%}, specificity of 79.0{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 74.6-82.8{\%}). Moderator analysis identified significant effects of age (p=0.029), imaging modality (p=0.019), and disease stage (p=0.025) on sensitivity as well as of positive-to-negative symptom ratio (p=0.022) and antipsychotic medication (p=0.016) on specificity. Our results underline the utility of multivariate pattern recognition approaches for the identification of reliable neuroimaging-based biomarkers. Despite the clinical heterogeneity of the schizophrenia phenotype, brain functional and structural alterations differentiate schizophrenic patients from healthy controls with 80{\%} sensitivity and specificity.},

However, the stability of anticorrelations across distinct DN subsystems, different contexts, and time, remains unexplored. Here we examine DN-DAN functional connectivity across six different cognitive states. We show that: (i) the DAN is anticorrelated with the DN core subsystem, but not with the two DN subsystems involved in mentalizing and mnemonic functions, respectively; (ii) DN-DAN interactions vary significantly across cognitive states; (iii) DN-DAN connectivity fluctuates across time between periods of anticorrelation and periods of positive correlation; and (iv) coupling between the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and DAN predicts variation in the strength of DN-DAN anticorrelation across time. These findings reveal substantial variability in DN-DAN interactions, suggesting that these networks are not strictly competitive, and that the FPCN may act to modulate their anticorrelation strength.},

abstract = {Anticorrelation between the default and dorsal attention networks is a central feature of human functional brain organization. Hallmarks of aging include impaired default network modulation and declining medial temporal lobe (MTL) function. However, it remains unclear if this anticorrelation is preserved into older adulthood during task performance, or how this is related to the intrinsic architecture of the brain. We hypothesized that older adults would show reduced within- and increased between-network functional connectivity (FC) across the default and dorsal attention networks. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of aging on task-related and intrinsic FC using functional magnetic resonance imaging during an autobiographical planning task known to engage the default network and during rest, respectively, with young (n??= 72) and older (n??= 79) participants. The task-related FC analysis revealed reduced anticorrelation with aging. At rest, there was a robust double dissociation, with older adults showing a pattern of reduced within-network FC, but increased between-network FC, across both networks, relative to young adults. Moreover, older adults showed reduced intrinsic resting-state FC of the MTL with both networks suggesting a fractionation of the MTL memory system in healthy aging. These findings demonstrate age-related dedifferentiation among these competitive large-scale networks during both task and rest, consistent with the idea that age-related changes are associated with a breakdown in the intrinsic functional architecture within and among large-scale brain networks.},

abstract = {In applied statistics, tools from machine learning are popular for analyzing complex and high-dimensional data. However, few theoretical results are available that could guide to the appropriate machine learning tool in a new application. Initial development of an overall strategy thus often implies that multiple methods are tested and compared on the same set of data. This is particularly difficult in situations that are prone to over-fitting where the number of subjects is low compared to the number of potential predictors. The article presents a game which provides some grounds for conducting a fair model comparison. Each player selects a modeling strategy for predicting individual response from potential predictors. A strictly proper scoring rule, bootstrap cross-validation, and a set of rules are used to make the results obtained with different strategies comparable. To illustrate the ideas, the game is applied to data from the Nugenob Study where the aim is to predict the fat oxidation capacity based on conventional factors and high-dimensional metabolomics data. Three players have chosen to use support vector machines, LASSO, and random forests, respectively.},

abstract = {A major challenge in neuroimaging is understanding the mapping of neurophysiological dynamics onto cognitive functions. Traditionally, these maps have been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions related to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced methods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive functions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However, these two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because few tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously considering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of community detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer) annotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates communities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community, and whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility of the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor learning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and annotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that encoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice. Interestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit the greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation magnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct dimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the tool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between functional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied to a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network data, and a second offers a regional attribute.},

abstract = {Graph theory has provided a key mathematical framework to analyse the architecture of human brain networks. This architecture embodies an inherently complex relationship between connection topology, the spatial arrangement of network elements, and the resulting network cost and functional performance. An exploration of these interacting factors and driving forces may reveal salient network features that are critically important for shaping and constraining the brain's topological organization and its evolvability. Several studies have pointed to an economic balance between network cost and network efficiency with networks organized in an 'economical' small-world favouring high communication efficiency at a low wiring cost. In this study, we define and explore a network morphospace in order to characterize different aspects of communication efficiency in human brain networks. Using a multi-objective evolutionary approach that approximates a Pareto-optimal set within the morphospace, we investigate the capacity of anatomical brain networks to evolve towards topologies that exhibit optimal information processing features while preserving network cost. This approach allows us to investigate network topologies that emerge under specific selection pressures, thus providing some insight into the selectional forces that may have shaped the network architecture of existing human brains.},

abstract = {As the human brain develops, it increasingly supports the coordinated synchronization and control of neural activity. The mechanism by which white matter evolves to support this coordination is not well understood. We use a network representation of diffusion imaging data to show that white matter connectivity becomes increasingly optimized for a diverse range of predicted dynamics in development. Such optimized topologies emerge across 882 youth from ages 8 to 22 evidencing increasing local specialization. Notably, stable controllers in subcortical areas are negatively related to cognitive performance. Seeking to investigate structural mechanisms that support these changes, we simulate network evolution with a set of growth rules, to find that all brain networks -- from child to adult -- are structured in a manner highly optimized for network control. We further observe differences in the predicted control mechanisms of the child and adult brains, suggesting that the white matter architecture in children has a greater potential to increasingly support brain state transitions, potentially underlying cognitive switching. This work suggests mechanisms for the propagation and stabilization of brain activity at various spatial scales, revealing a possible mechanism of human brain development that preferentially optimizes dynamic network control over static features of network architecture.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is increasingly recognized as a disorder of distributed neural dynamics, but the molecular and genetic contributions are poorly understood. Recent work highlights a role for altered N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling and related impairments in the excitation–inhibitory balance and synchrony of large-scale neural networks. Here, we combined a pharmacological intervention with novel techniques from dynamic network neuroscience applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify alterations in the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks related to schizophrenia genetic risk and NMDA receptor hypofunction. We quantified “network flexibility,” a measure of the dynamic reconfiguration of the community structure of time-variant brain networks during working memory performance. Comparing 28 patients with schizophrenia, 37 unaffected first-degree relatives, and 139 healthy controls, we detected significant differences in network flexibility [F(2,196) = 6.541, P= 0.002] in a pattern consistent with the assumed genetic risk load of the groups (highest for patients, intermediate for relatives, and lowest for controls). In an observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over pharmacological challenge study in 37 healthy controls, we further detected a significant increase in network flexibility as a result of NMDA receptor antagonism with 120 mg dextromethorphan [F(1,34) = 5.291, P = 0.028]. Our results identify a potential dy- namic network intermediate phenotype related to the genetic liability for schizophrenia that manifests as altered reconfiguration of brain networks during working memory. The phenotype appears to be influenced by NMDA receptor antagonism, consistent with a critical role for glutamate in the temporal coordination of neural networks and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Correct annotation of the genetic relationships between samples is essential for population genomic studies, which could be biased by errors or omissions. To this end, we used identity-by-state (IBS) and identity-by-descent (IBD) methods to assess genetic relatedness of individuals within HapMap phase III data. We analyzed data from 1,397 individuals across 11 ethnic populations. Our results support previous studies (Pemberton et al., 2010; Kyriazopoulou-Panagiotopoulou et al., 2011) assessing unknown relatedness present within this population. Additionally, we present evidence for 1,657 novel pairwise relationships across 9 populations. Surprisingly, significant Cotterman's coefficients of relatedness K1 (IBD1) values were detected between pairs of known parents. Furthermore, significant K2 (IBD2) values were detected in 32 previously annotated parent-child relationships. Consistent with a hypothesis of inbreeding, regions of homozygosity (ROH) were identified in the offspring of related parents, of which a subset overlapped those reported in previous studies (Gibson et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011). In total, we inferred 28 inbred individuals with ROH that overlapped areas of relatedness between the parents and/or IBD2 sharing at a different genomic locus between a child and a parent. Finally, 8 previously annotated parent-child relationships had unexpected K0 (IBD0) values (resulting from a chromosomal abnormality or genotype error), and 10 previously annotated second-degree relationships along with 38 other novel pairwise relationships had unexpected IBD2 (indicating two separate paths of recent ancestry). These newly described types of relatedness may impact the outcome of previous studies and should inform the design of future studies relying on the HapMap Phase III resource.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is still one of the most mysterious and costliest mental disorders in terms of human suffering and societal expenditure. Here, we focus on the key developments in biology, epidemiology, and pharmacology of schizophrenia and provide a syndromal framework in which these aspects can be understood together. Symptoms typically emerge in adolescence and early adulthood. The incidence of the disorder varies greatly across places and migrant groups, as do symptoms, course, and treatment response across individuals. Genetic vulnerability is shared in part with bipolar disorder and recent molecular genetic findings also indicate an overlap with developmental disorders such as autism. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission, the latter being directly related to hallucinations and delusions. Pharmacological treatments, which block the dopamine system, are effective for delusions and hallucinations but less so for disabling cognitive and motivational impairments. Specific vocational and psychological interventions, in combination with antipsychotic medication in a context of community-case management, can improve functional outcome but are not widely available. 100 years after being so named, research is beginning to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of schizophrenia and the psychosocial factors that moderate their expression. Although current treatments provide control rather than cure, long-term hospitalisation is not required and prognosis is better than traditionally assumed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Feature extraction and selection are key factors in model reduction, classification and pattern recognition problems. This is especially important for input data with large dimensions such as brain recording or multiview images, where appropriate feature extraction is a prerequisite to classification. To ensure that the reduced dataset contains maximum information about input data we propose algorithms for feature extraction and classification. This is achieved based on orthogonal or nonnegative tensor (multi-array) decompositions, and higher order (multilinear) discriminant analysis (HODA), whereby input data are considered as tensors instead of more conventional vector or matrix representations. The developed algorithms are verified on benchmark datasets, using constraints imposed on tensors and/or factor matrices such as orthogonality and nonnegativity.},

abstract = {The development of various neuroimaging techniques is rapidly improving the measurements of brain function/structure. However, despite improvements in individual modalities, it is becoming increasingly clear that the most effective research approaches will utilize multi-modal fusion, which takes advantage of the fact that each modality provides a limited view of the brain. The goal of multi-modal fusion is to capitalize on the strength of each modality in a joint analysis, rather than a separate analysis of each. This is a more complicated endeavor that must be approached more carefully and efficient methods should be developed to draw generalized and valid conclusions from high dimensional data with a limited number of subjects. Numerous research efforts have been reported in the field based on various statistical approaches, e.g. independent component analysis (ICA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). In this review paper, we survey a number of multivariate methods appearing in previous multimodal fusion reports, mostly fMRI with other modality, which were performed with or without prior information. A table for comparing optimization assumptions, purpose of the analysis, the need of priors, dimension reduction strategies and input data types is provided, which may serve as a valuable reference that helps readers understand the trade-offs of the 7 methods comprehensively. Finally, we evaluate 3 representative methods via simulation and give some suggestions on how to select an appropriate method based on a given research. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{LeFloch2012a,
abstract = {Brain imaging is increasingly recognised as an intermediate phenotype to understand the complex path between genetics and behavioural or clinical phenotypes. In this context, a first goal is to propose methods to identify the part of genetic variability that explains some neuroimaging variability. Classical univariate approaches often ignore the potential joint effects that may exist between genes or the potential covariations between brain regions. In this paper, we propose instead to investigate an exploratory multivariate method in order to identify a set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) covarying with a set of neuroimaging phenotypes derived from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Recently, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed to analyse DNA and transcriptomics. Here, we propose to transpose this idea to the DNA vs. imaging context. However, in very high-dimensional settings like in imaging genetics studies, such multivariate methods may encounter overfitting issues. Thus we investigate the use of different strategies of regularisation and dimension reduction techniques combined with PLS or CCA to face the very high dimensionality of imaging genetics studies. We propose a comparison study of the different strategies on a simulated dataset first and then on a real dataset composed of 94 subjects, around 600,000 SNPs and 34 functional MRI lateralisation indexes computed from reading and speech comprehension contrast maps. We estimate the generalisability of the multivariate association with a cross-validation scheme and demonstrate the significance of this link, using a permutation procedure. Univariate selection appears to be necessary to reduce the dimensionality. However, the significant association uncovered by this two-step approach combining univariate filtering and L1-regularised PLS suggests that discovering meaningful genetic associations calls for a multivariate approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Identification of the early signs of schizophrenia would be a major achievement for the early intervention and prevention strategies in psychiatry. Social impairments are defining features of schizophrenia. Impairments of individual layers of social competencies are frequently described in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), who have high risk of schizophrenia. It is unclear whether and to what extent social impairments associate with subclinical negative and positive symptoms in 22q11.2DS, and which layer of social impairments are more correlated with schizophrenia-related symptoms. The aims of this study were to conduct a comprehensive investigation of social impairments at three different levels (function, skill, and cognition) and their interrelationship and to determine to what degree the social impairments correlate to subclinical levels of negative and positive symptoms, respectively, in a young cohort of 22q11.2DS not diagnosed with schizophrenia. Methods: The level of social impairment was addressed using questionnaires and objective measures of social functioning (The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System), skills (Social Responsiveness Scale), and cognition (The Awareness of Social Inference Test and CANTAB Emotional Recognition Task), and the presence of subclinical symptoms of schizophrenia were evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes in a cross-sectional case-control study of 29 cases and 29 controls, aged 12 to 25 years. Association between social impairment and negative and positive symptoms levels was examined in cases only. Results: Subjects with 22q11.2DS were highly impaired in social function, social skills, and social cognition (p ≤ 6.2 × 10-9) relative to control peers and presented with more negative (p = 5.8 × 10-11) and positive (p = 7.5 × 10-4) symptoms. In particular, social functional and skill levels were highly associated with notably subclinical negative symptoms levels. Conclusions: This study shows strong correlations between levels of social impairments and subclinical negative and positive symptoms. However, longitudinal studies are required to show if social impairments represent early disease manifestations. If parental or self-reporting suggests severe social impairment, it should advocate for clinical awareness not only to social deficits per se but also of potential subclinical psychosis symptoms.},

abstract = {Despite extensive research into executive function (EF), the precise relationship between brain dynamics and flexible cognition remains unknown. Using a large, publicly available dataset (189 participants), we find that functional connections measured throughout 56minutes of resting state fMRI data comprise five distinct connectivity states. Elevated EF performance as measured outside of the scanner was associated with greater episodes of more frequently occurring connectivity states, and fewer episodes of less frequently occurring connectivity states. Frequently occurring states displayed metastable properties, where cognitive flexibility may be facilitated by attenuated correlations and greater functional connection variability. Less frequently occurring states displayed properties consistent with low arousal and low vigilance. These findings suggest that elevated EF performance may be associated with the propensity to occupy more frequently occurring brain configurations that enable cognitive flexibility, while avoiding less frequently occurring brain configurations related to low arousal/vigilance states. The current findings offer a novel framework for identifying neural processes related to individual differences in executive function.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship of resting-state fMRI functional connectivity estimated over long periods of time with time-varying functional connectivity estimated over shorter time intervals. We show that using Pearson's correlation to estimate functional connectivity implies that the range of fluctuations of functional connections over short time-scales is subject to statistical constraints imposed by their connectivity strength over longer scales. We present a method for estimating time-varying functional connectivity that is designed to mitigate this issue and allows us to identify episodes where functional connections are unexpectedly strong or weak. We apply this method to data recorded from N= 80 participants, and show that the number of unexpectedly strong/weak connections fluctuates over time, and that these variations coincide with intermittent periods of high and low modularity in time-varying functional connectivity. We also find that during periods of relative quiescence regions associated with default mode network tend to join communities with attentional, control, and primary sensory systems. In contrast, during periods where many connections are unexpectedly strong/weak, default mode regions dissociate and form distinct modules. Finally, we go on to show that, while all functional connections can at times manifest stronger (more positively correlated) or weaker (more negatively correlated) than expected, a small number of connections, mostly within the visual and somatomotor networks, do so a disproportional number of times. Our statistical approach allows the detection of functional connections that fluctuate more or less than expected based on their long-time averages and may be of use in future studies characterizing the spatio-temporal patterns of time-varying functional connectivity.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Variability in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals reflects the moment by moment fluctuations in resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) activity within specific areas of the brain. Regional BOLD signal variability was recently proposed to serve an important functional role in the efficacy of neural systems due to its relationship to behavioural performance in aging and cognition studies. We previously showed that individuals who better cope with pain have greater fluctuations in inter-regional functional connectivity (FC), but it is not known whether regional brain signal variability is a mechanism underlying pain coping. Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual pain sensitivity and coping is reflected by regional fMRI BOLD signal variability within dynamic pain connectome- brain systems implicated in the pain experience. We acquired rs-fMRI and assessed pain threshold, suprathreshold temporal summation of pain (TSP) and the impact of pain on cognition in 80 healthy, right-handed individuals. We found that regional BOLD signal variability: 1) inversely correlated with an individual's TSP within the ascending nociceptive pathway (primary and secondary somatosensory cortex), default mode network, and salience network; 2) was correlated with an individual's ability to cope with pain during a cognitive interference task within the periaqueductal gray, a key opiate-rich brainstem structure for descending pain modulation; and 3) provided information not captured from inter-regional functional connectivity. Therefore, regional BOLD variability represents a pain metric with potential implications for prediction of chronic pain resilience versus vulnerability.},

In typical development, basic attentional processes may provide a critical foundation for sociocommunicative abilities. Therefore early attentional dysfunction in ASD may result in atypical development of social communication. Prior research has demonstrated that persons with ASD exhibit early and lifelong impairments in attention. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a review of the extant research on attention in ASD using a framework of functionally independent attentional networks as conceptualized by Posner and colleagues: the alerting, orienting and executive control networks (Posner and Petersen, 1990; Petersen and Posner, 2012). The neural substrates and typical development of each attentional network are briefly discussed, a review of the ASD attention literature is presented, and a hypothesis is proposed that links aberrant attentional mechanisms, specifically impaired disengagement of attention, with the emergence of core ASD symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {During the last several years, the focus of research on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shifted from the analysis of functional connectivity averaged over the duration of scanning sessions to the analysis of changes of functional connectivity within sessions. Although several studies have reported the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), statistical assessment of the results is not always carried out in a sound way and, in some studies, is even omitted. In this study, we explain why appropriate statistical tests are needed to detect dFC, we describe how they can be carried out and how to assess the performance of dFC measures, and we illustrate the methodology using spontaneous blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10 min, it is almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical methods.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging enables rich noninvasive measurements of human brain activity, but translating such data into neuroscientific insights and clinical applications requires complex analyses and collaboration among a diverse array of researchers. The open science movement is reshaping scientific culture and addressing the challenges of transparency and reproducibility of research. To advance open science in neuroimaging the Organization for Human Brain Mapping created the Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS), charged with creating a report that collects best practice recommendations from experts and the entire brain imaging community. The purpose of this work is to elaborate the principles of open and reproducible research for neuroimaging using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and then distill these principles to specific research practices. Many elements of a study are so varied that practice cannot be prescribed, but for these areas we detail the information that must be reported to fully understand and potentially replicate a study. For other elements of a study, like statistical modelling where specific poor practices can be identified, and the emerging areas of data sharing and reproducibility, we detail both good practice and reporting standards. For each of seven areas of a study we provide tabular listing of over 100 items to help plan, execute, report and share research in the most transparent fashion. Whether for individual scientists, or for editors and reviewers, we hope these guidelines serve as a benchmark, to raise the standards of practice and reporting in neuroimaging using MRI.},

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia and related psychoses are associated with brain structural abnormalities. Recent findings in 'at risk' populations have identified progressive changes in various brain regions preceding illness onset, while changes especially in prefrontal and superior temporal regions have been demonstrated in first-episode schizophrenia patients. However, the timing of the cortical changes and their regional extent, relative to the emergence of psychosis, has not been clarified. We followed individuals at high-risk for psychosis to determine whether structural changes in the cerebral cortex occur with the onset of psychosis. We hypothesized that progressive volume loss occurs in prefrontal regions during the transition to psychosis. Methods: 35 individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing psychosis, of whom 12 experienced psychotic onset by 1-year follow-up ('converters'), participated in a longitudinal structural MRI study. Baseline and follow-up T1-weighted MR images were acquired and longitudinal brain surface contractions were assessed using Cortical Pattern Matching. Results: Significantly greater brain contraction was found in the right prefrontal region in the 'converters' compared with UHR cases who did not develop psychosis ('non-converters'). Conclusions: These findings show cortical volume loss is associated with the onset of psychosis, indicating ongoing pathological processes during the transition stage to illness. The prefrontal volume loss is in line with structural and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia, suggesting a critical role for this change in the development of psychosis.},

abstract = {Brain functional connectivity has been studied by analyzing time series correlations in regional brain activities based on resting-state fMRI data. Brain functional connectivity can be depicted as a network or graph defined as a set of nodes linked by edges. Nodes represent brain regions and an edge measures the strength of functional correlation between two regions. Most of existing work focuses on estimation of such a network. A key but inadequately addressed question is how to test for possible differences of the networks between two subject groups, say between healthy controls and patients. Here we illustrate and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art statistical tests drawn from the neuroimaging, genetics, ecology and high-dimensional data literatures. Both real and simulated data were used to evaluate the methods. We found that Network Based Statistic (NBS) performed well in many but not all situations, and its performance critically depends on the choice of its threshold parameter, which is unknown and difficult to choose in practice. Importantly, two adaptive statistical tests called adaptive sum of powered score (aSPU) and its weighted version (aSPUw) are easy to use and complementary to NBS, being higher powered than NBS in some situations. The aSPU and aSPUw tests can also be applied to adjust for covariates. Between the aSPU and aSPUw tests, they often, but not always, performed similarly with neither one as a uniform winner. On the other hand, Multivariate Matrix Distance Regression (MDMR) has been applied to detect group differences for brain connectivity; with the usual choice of the Euclidean distance, MDMR is a special case of the aSPU test. Consequently NBS, aSPU and aSPUw tests are recommended to test for group differences in functional connectivity.},

abstract = {In functional brain mapping, pattern recognition methods allow detecting multivoxel patterns of brain activation which are informative with respect to a subject's perceptual or cognitive state. The sensitivity of these methods, however, is greatly reduced when the proportion of voxels that convey the discriminative information is small compared to the total number of measured voxels. To reduce this dimensionality problem, previous studies employed univariate voxel selection or region-of-interest-based strategies as a preceding step to the application of machine learning algorithms. Here we employ a strategy for classifying functional imaging data based on a multivariate feature selection algorithm, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) that uses the training algorithm (support vector machine) recursively to eliminate irrelevant voxels and estimate informative spatial patterns. Generalization performances on test data increases while features/voxels are pruned based on their discrimination ability. In this article we evaluate RFE in terms of sensitivity of discriminative maps (Receiver Operative Characteristic analysis) and generalization performances and compare it to previously used univariate voxel selection strategies based on activation and discrimination measures. Using simulated fMRI data, we show that the recursive approach is suitable for mapping discriminative patterns and that the combination of an initial univariate activation-based (F-test) reduction of voxels and multivariate recursive feature elimination produces the best results, especially when differences between conditions have a low contrast-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we apply our method to high resolution (2 ?? 2 ?? 2mm3) data from an auditory fMRI experiment in which subjects were stimulated with sounds from four different categories. With these real data, our recursive algorithm proves able to detect and accurately classify multivoxel spatial patterns, highlighting the role of the superior temporal gyrus in encoding the information of sound categories. In line with the simulation results, our method outperforms univariate statistical analysis and statistical learning without feature selection. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We report a reproducible and internally valid subject-specific areal-level parcellation that corresponds with subject-specific task activations. Highly convergent correlation network estimates can be derived from this parcellation if sufficient data are collected-considerably more than typically acquired. Notably, within-subject correlation variability across sessions exhibited a heterogeneous distribution across the cortex concentrated in visual and somato-motor regions, distinct from the pattern of intersubject variability. Further, although the individual's systems-level organization is broadly similar to the group, it demonstrates distinct topological features.

abstract = {Recently, functional connectivity analyses using spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations have been applied in the context of neurological and psychiatry diseases. In the analyses procedure, preprocessing steps are commonly utilized in exploring functional connectivity, the same strategy as what was conducted in the fMRI process. However, the effectiveness of these preprocessing steps on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was rarely investigated, and the significance of preprocessing steps on rs-fMRI needs to be studied. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of multiple preprocessing procedures, including slice-timing correction, smoothing, and spatial normalization, on rs-fMRI signal. Through a seed-based correlation analysis on the motor network, we empirically estimated three indices of spontaneous fMRI fluctuations induced: correlation coefficients (CC), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), and fractional ALFF (fALFF), with different strategies of three preprocessing steps. Multiple repetition times (TRs = 2, 3, 4 sec) were also compared to address the issue of temporal mismatch. In the temporal preprocess, we found that the use of slice-timing correction and different TRs had minimal effects on CC and fALFF. However, ALFF was significantly affected using different TR but not affected by slice-timing correction as well. In the spatial preprocess, fALFF was insensitive to both smoothing and normalization. Smoothing consistently increased spatial extents and CC, but suppressed ALFF values. Performing normalization before index calculations provided better spatial sensitivity with larger variability in ALFF, whereas performing normalization after index calculations might preserve the ALFF level as in the unnormalized data. Conclusively, the effects of choosing preprocessing parameters and strategies were presented in the current study, providing practical considerations when conducting rs-fMRI analyses.},

abstract = {As researchers increase their efforts to characterize variations in the functional connectome across studies and individuals, concerns about the many sources of nuisance variation present and their impact on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although substantial within-site variation can exist, efforts to aggregate data across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present work draws upon standardization approaches commonly used in the microarray gene expression literature, and to a lesser extent recent imaging studies, and compares them with respect to their impact on relationships between common R-fMRI measures and nuisance variables (e.g., imaging site, motion), as well as phenotypic variables of interest (age, sex). Standardization approaches differed with regard to whether they were applied post-hoc vs. during pre-processing, and at the individual vs. group level; additionally they varied in whether they addressed additive effects vs. additive. +. multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs. non-parametric. While all standardization approaches were effective at reducing undesirable relationships with nuisance variables, post-hoc approaches were generally more effective than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches, correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be more important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for all R-fMRI measures, with the exception of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). Group-level post-hoc standardizations for mean-centering and variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in their ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual relationships with standardization parameters; though results between individual and group-level post-hoc approaches were highly similar overall. While post-hoc standardization procedures drastically increased test-retest (TRT) reliability for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other measures after post-hoc standardizations-a phenomena likely attributable to the separation of voxel-wise from global differences among subjects (global mean and SD demonstrated moderate TRT reliability for these measures). Finally, the present work calls into question previous observations of increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean centering, and draws attention to the near equivalence of global and gray matter signal regression. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Analysis of both task based and resting state functional network properties has indicated that the PASA can also be characterized in terms of modulation of functional network properties, and that the onset of AD appears to accentuate this modulation. We also explore the effect of spatial normalization upon the results of our analysis.},

abstract = {The identification of phenotypic associations in high-dimensional brain connectivity data represents the next frontier in the neuroimaging connectomics era. Exploration of brain-phenotype relationships remains limited by statistical approaches that are computationally intensive, depend on a priori hypotheses, or require stringent correction for multiple comparisons. Here, we propose a computationally efficient, data-driven technique for connectome-wide association studies (CWAS) that provides a comprehensive voxel-wise survey of brain-behavior relationships across the connectome; the approach identifies voxels whose whole-brain connectivity patterns vary significantly with a phenotypic variable. Using resting state fMRI data, we demonstrate the utility of our analytic framework by identifying significant connectivity-phenotype relationships for full-scale IQ and assessing their overlap with existent neuroimaging findings, as synthesized by openly available automated meta-analysis (www.neurosynth.org). The results appeared to be robust to the removal of nuisance covariates (i.e., mean connectivity, global signal, and motion) and varying brain resolution (i.e., voxelwise results are highly similar to results using 800 parcellations). We show that CWAS findings can be used to guide subsequent seed-based correlation analyses. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach by examining CWAS for three additional datasets, each encompassing a distinct phenotypic variable: neurotypical development, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder diagnostic status, and L-DOPA pharmacological manipulation. For each phenotype, our approach to CWAS identified distinct connectome-wide association profiles, not previously attainable in a single study utilizing traditional univariate approaches. As a computationally efficient, extensible, and scalable method, our CWAS framework can accelerate the discovery of brain-behavior relationships in the connectome. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We performed a longitudinal voxel-based morphometry analysis using structural T1 MRI scans from 19 individuals with 22q11.2DS and 18 typically developing individuals. In 22q11.2DS, univariate analysis showed that greater reduction in left dorsal prefrontal cortical (dPFC) GMV over time predicted greater psychotic symptoms at Time2. This dPFC region also showed significantly reduced volumes in 22q11.2DS compared to typically developing individuals at Time1 and 2, greater reduction over time in 22q11.2DS COMTMet compared to COMTVal, and greater reduction in those with greater decline in verbal IQ over time. Leave-one-out Multivariate pattern analysis results (MVPA) on the other hand, showed that patterns of GM and WM morphometric changes over time in regions including but not limited to the dPFC predicted risk for psychotic symptoms (94.7-100{\%} accuracy) significantly better than using univariate analysis (63.1{\%}). Additional predictive brain regions included medial PFC and dorsal cingulum. This longitudinal prospective study shows novel evidence of morphometric spatial patterns predicting the development of psychotic symptoms in 22q11.2DS, and further elucidates the abnormal maturational processes in 22q11.2DS. The use of neuroimaging using MVPA may hold promise to predict outcome in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Measures of brain connectivity are currently subject to intense scientific and clinical interest. Multiple measures are available, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here, we study epilepsy patients with intracranial electrodes, and compare four different measures of connectivity. Perhaps the most direct measure derives from intracranial electrodes; however, this is invasive and spatial coverage is incomplete. These electrodes can be actively stimulated to trigger electrophysical responses to provide the first measure of connectivity. A second measure is the recent development of simultaneous BOLD fMRI and intracranial electrode stimulation. The resulting BOLD maps form a measure of effective connectivity. A third measure uses low frequency BOLD fluctuations measured by MRI, with functional connectivity defined as the temporal correlation coefficient between their BOLD waveforms. A fourth measure is structural, derived from diffusion MRI, with connectivity defined as an integrated diffusivity measure along a connecting pathway. This method addresses the difficult requirement to measure connectivity between any two points in the brain, reflecting the relatively arbitrary location of the surgical placement of intracranial electrodes. Using a group of eight epilepsy patients with intracranial electrodes, the connectivity from one method is compared to another method using all paired data points that are in common, yielding an overall correlation coefficient. This method is performed for all six paired-comparisons between the four methods. While these show statistically significant correlations, the magnitudes of the correlation are relatively modest (r (2) between 0.20 and 0.001). In summary, there are many pairs of points in the brain that correlate well using one measure yet correlate poorly using another measure. These experimental findings present a complicated picture regarding the measure or meaning of brain connectivity.},

abstract = {Structural connectivity in the brain is the basis of functional connectivity. Quantitatively linking the two, however, remains a challenge. For a pair of ROIs, anatomical connections derived from diffusion weighted imaging are often quantified by FA (fractional anisotropy) or edge weight, whereas functional connections derived from resting-state fMRI can be characterized by non-time-series measures such as zero-lag cross correlation, partial correlation, as well as by time-series measures such as coherence and Granger causality. In this study we addressed the question of linking structural and functional connectivity quantitatively by considering two pairs of ROIs, one from the default mode network (DMN) and the other from the central executive network (CEN), using two different datasets. Selecting (1) PCC and mPFC of the DMN as the first pair of ROIs and (2) left DLPFC and left IPL of the CEN as the second pair of ROIs, we show that (1) zero-lag cross correlation, partial correlation and pairwise Granger causality were not significantly correlated with either mean FA or edge weight and (2) conditional Granger causality was significantly correlated with edge weight but not mean FA. These results suggest that (1) edge weight may be a more appropriate measure to quantify the strength of the anatomical connection between ROIs and (2) conditional Granger causality, which statistically removes common input and the indirect influences between a given ROI pair, may be a more appropriate measure to quantify the strength of the functional interaction enabled by the fibers linking the two ROIs.},

By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity (FC) as measured by correlation between fMRI BOLD time courses of distinct brain regions has revealed meaningful organization of spontaneous fluctuations in the resting brain. However, an increasing amount of evidence points to non-stationarity of FC; i.e., FC dynamically changes over time reflecting additional and rich information about brain organization, but representing new challenges for analysis and interpretation. Here, we propose a data-driven approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal hidden patterns of coherent FC dynamics across multiple subjects. We demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of this new approach by examining the differences in dynamic FC between 13 healthy control subjects and 15 minimally disabled relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. We estimated whole-brain dynamic FC of regionally-averaged BOLD activity using sliding time windows. We then used PCA to identify FC patterns, termed "eigenconnectivities", that reflect meaningful patterns in FC fluctuations. We then assessed the contributions of these patterns to the dynamic FC at any given time point and identified a network of connections centered on the default-mode network with altered contribution in patients. Our results complement traditional stationary analyses, and reveal novel insights into brain connectivity dynamics and their modulation in a neurodegenerative disease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is highly variable across the duration of a scan. Groups of coevolving connections, or reproducible patterns of dynamic FC (dFC), have been revealed in fluctuating FC by applying unsupervised learning techniques. Based on results from k-means clustering and sliding-window correlations, it has recently been hypothesized that dFC may cycle through several discrete FC states. Alternatively, it has been proposed to represent dFC as a linear combination of multiple FC patterns using principal component analysis. As it is unclear whether sparse or nonsparse combinations of FC patterns are most appropriate, and as this affects their interpretation and use as markers of cognitive processing, the goal of our study was to evaluate the impact of sparsity by performing an empirical evaluation of simulated, task-based, and resting-state dFC. To this aim, we applied matrix factorizations subject to variable constraints in the temporal domain and studied both the reproducibility of ensuing representations of dFC and the expression of FC patterns over time. During subject-driven tasks, dFC was well described by alternating FC states in accordance with the nature of the data. The estimated FC patterns showed a rich structure with combinations of known functional networks enabling accurate identification of three different tasks. During rest, dFC was better described by multiple FC patterns that overlap. The executive control networks, which are critical for working memory, appeared grouped alternately with externally or internally oriented networks. These results suggest that combinations of FC patterns can provide a meaningful way to disentangle resting-state dFC. Hum Brain Mapp, 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {From toddler to late teenager, the macroscopic pattern of axonal projections in the human brain remains largely unchanged while undergoing dramatic functional modifications that lead to network refinement. These functional modifications are mediated by increasing myelination and changes in axonal diameter and synaptic density, as well as changes in neurochemical mediators. Here we explore the contribution of white matter maturation to the development of connectivity between ages 2 and 18 y using high b-value diffusion MRI tractography and connectivity analysis. We measured changes in connection efficacy as the inverse of the average diffusivity along a fiber tract. We observed significant refinement in specific metrics of network topology, including a significant increase in node strength and efficiency along with a decrease in clustering. Major structural modules and hubs were in place by 2 y of age, and they continued to strengthen their profile during subsequent development. Recording resting-state functional MRI from a subset of subjects, we confirmed a positive correlation between structural and functional connectivity, and in addition observed that this relationship strengthened with age. Continuously increasing integration and decreasing segregation of structural connectivity with age suggests that network refinement mediated by white matter maturation promotes increased global efficiency. In addition, the strengthening of the correlation between structural and functional connectivity with age suggests that white matter connectivity in combination with other factors, such as differential modulation of axonal diameter and myelin thickness, that are partially captured by inverse average diffusivity, play an increasingly important role in creating brain-wide coherence and synchrony.},

To study the system wide impact of regional stimulation, we employ a data-driven computational model of nonlinear brain dynamics to systematically explore the effects of targeted stimulation. Validating predictions from network control theory, we uncover the relationship between regional controllability and the focal versus global impact of stimulation, and we relate these findings to differences in the underlying network architecture. Finally, by mapping brain regions to cognitive systems, we observe that the default mode system imparts large global change despite being highly constrained by structural connectivity.

abstract = {Most studies of resting-state functional connectivity using fMRI employ methods that assume temporal stationarity, such as correlation and data-driven decompositions computed across the duration of the scan. However, evidence from both task-based fMRI studies and animal electrophysiology suggests that functional connectivity may exhibit dynamic changes within time scales of seconds to minutes. In the present study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of resting-state connectivity across the course of a single scan, performing a time-frequency coherence analysis based on the wavelet transform. We focused on the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a primary node of the default-mode network, examining its relationship with both the "anticorrelated" ("task-positive") network as well as other nodes of the default-mode network. It was observed that coherence and phase between the PCC and the anticorrelated network was variable in time and frequency, and statistical testing based on Monte Carlo simulations revealed the presence of significant scale-dependent temporal variability. In addition, a sliding-window correlation procedure identified other regions across the brain that exhibited variable connectivity with the PCC across the scan, which included areas previously implicated in attention and salience processing. Although it is unclear whether the observed coherence and phase variability can be attributed to residual noise or modulation of cognitive state, the present results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static, and it may therefore prove valuable to consider measures of variability, in addition to average quantities, when characterizing resting-state networks. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We first give a brief introduction to graph theoretical analysis and its application to the study of brain network topology or connectomics. Within this framework, we review the existing empirical data on developmental changes in brain network organization across a range of experimental modalities (including structural and functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans). SYNTHESIS: We discuss preliminary evidence and current hypotheses for how the emergence of network properties correlates with concomitant cognitive and behavioural changes associated with development. We highlight some of the technical and conceptual challenges to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly moving field. Given the parallels previously discovered between neural systems across species and over a range of spatial scales, we also review some recent advances in developmental network studies at the cellular scale. We highlight the opportunities presented by such studies and how they may complement neuroimaging in advancing our understanding of brain development. Finally, we note that many brain and mind disorders are thought to be neurodevelopmental in origin and that charting the trajectory of brain network changes associated with healthy development also sets the stage for understanding abnormal network development. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore briefly review the clinical relevance of network metrics as potential diagnostic markers and some recent efforts in computational modelling of brain networks which might contribute to a more mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders in future.},

abstract = {Human learning is a complex phenomenon requiring flexibility to adapt existing brain function and precision in selecting new neurophysiological activities to drive desired behavior. These two attributes-flexibility and selection-must operate over multiple temporal scales as performance of a skill changes from being slow and challenging to being fast and automatic. Such selective adaptability is naturally provided by modular structure, which plays a critical role in evolution, development, and optimal network function. Using functional connectivity measurements of brain activity acquired from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate the role of modularity in human learning by identifying dynamic changes of modular organization spanning multiple temporal scales. Our results indicate that flexibility, which we measure by the allegiance of nodes to modules, in one experimental session predicts the relative amount of learning in a future session. We also develop a general statistical framework for the identification of modular architectures in evolving systems, which is broadly applicable to disciplines where network adaptability is crucial to the understanding of system performance.},

abstract = {The anatomical connectivity of the human brain supports diverse patterns of correlated neural activity that are thought to underlie cognitive function. In a manner sensitive to underlying structural brain architecture, we examine the extent to which such patterns of correlated activity systematically vary across cognitive states. Anatomical white matter connectivity is compared with functional correlations in neural activity measured via blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals. Functional connectivity is separately measured at rest, during an attention task, and during a memory task. We assess these structural and functional measures within previously-identified resting-state functional networks, denoted task-positive and task-negative networks, that have been independently shown to be strongly anticorrelated at rest but also involve regions of the brain that routinely increase and decrease in activity during task-driven processes. We find that the density of anatomical connections within and between task-positive and task-negative networks is differentially related to strong, task-dependent correlations in neural activity. The space mapped out by the observed structure-function relationships is used to define a quantitative measure of separation between resting, attention, and memory states. We find that the degree of separation between states is related to both general measures of behavioral performance and relative differences in task-specific measures of attention versus memory performance. These findings suggest that the observed separation between cognitive states reflects underlying organizational principles of human brain structure and function.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, scientific interest in the properties of large-scale spontaneous neural dynamics has intensified. Concurrently, novel technologies have been developed for characterizing the connective anatomy of intra-regional circuits and inter-regional fiber pathways. It will soon be possible to build computational models that incorporate these newly detailed structural network measurements to make predictions of neural dynamics at multiple scales. Here, we review the practicality and the value of these efforts, while at the same time considering in which cases and to what extent structure does determine neural function. Studies of the healthy brain, of neural development, and of pathology all yield examples of direct correspondences between structural linkage and dynamical correlation. Theoretical arguments further support the notion that brain network topology and spatial embedding should strongly influence network dynamics. Although future models will need to be tested more quantitatively and against a wider range of empirical neurodynamic features, our present large-scale models can already predict the macroscopic pattern of dynamic correlation across the brain. We conclude that as neuroscience grapples with datasets of increasing completeness and complexity, and attempts to relate the structural and functional architectures discovered at different neural scales, the value of computational modeling will continue to grow. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The complex relationship between structural and functional connectivity, as measured by noninvasive imaging of the human brain, poses many unresolved challenges and open questions. Here, we apply analytic measures of network communication to the structural connectivity of the human brain and explore the capacity of these measures to predict resting-state functional connectivity across three independently acquired datasets. We focus on the layout of shortest paths across the network and on two communication measures--search information and path transitivity--which account for how these paths are embedded in the rest of the network. Search information is an existing measure of information needed to access or trace shortest paths; we introduce path transitivity to measure the density of local detours along the shortest path. We find that both search information and path transitivity predict the strength of functional connectivity among both connected and unconnected node pairs. They do so at levels that match or significantly exceed path length measures, Euclidean distance, as well as computational models of neural dynamics. This capacity suggests that dynamic couplings due to interactions among neural elements in brain networks are substantially influenced by the broader network context adjacent to the shortest communication pathways.},

abstract = {Many functional network properties of the human brain have been identified during rest and task states, yet it remains unclear how the two relate. We identified a whole-brain network architecture present across dozens of task states that was highly similar to the resting-state network architecture. The most frequent functional connectivity strengths across tasks closely matched the strengths observed at rest, suggesting this is an "intrinsic," standard architecture of functional brain organization. Furthermore, a set of small but consistent changes common across tasks suggests the existence of a task-general network architecture distinguishing task states from rest. These results indicate the brain's functional network architecture during task performance is shaped primarily by an intrinsic network architecture that is also present during rest, and secondarily by evoked task-general and task-specific network changes. This establishes astrong relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity-areas of neuroscientific inquiry typically considered separately. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

To study the system wide impact of regional stimulation, we employ a data-driven computational model of nonlinear brain dynamics to systematically explore the effects of targeted stimulation. Validating predictions from network control theory, we uncover the relationship between regional controllability and the focal versus global impact of stimulation, and we relate these findings to differences in the underlying network architecture. Finally, by mapping brain regions to cognitive systems, we observe that the default mode system imparts large global change despite being highly constrained by structural connectivity.

How does the brain's network of anatomical connections help facilitate such transitions? Which features of this network contribute to making one transition easy and another transition difficult? Here, we address these questions using network control theory. We calculate the optimal input signals to drive the brain to and from states dominated by different cognitive systems. The input signals allow us to assess the contributions made by different brain regions. We show that such contributions, which we measure as energy, are correlated with regions' weighted degrees. We also show that the network communicability, a measure of direct and indirect connectedness between brain regions, predicts the extent to which brain regions compensate when input to another region is suppressed. Finally, we identify optimal states in which the brain should start (and finish) in order to minimize transition energy. We show that the optimal target states display high activity in hub regions, implicating the brain's rich club. Furthermore, when rich club organization is destroyed, the energy cost associated with state transitions increases significantly, demonstrating that it is the richness of brain regions that makes them ideal targets.},

abstract = {The complexity of neural dynamics stems in part from the complexity of the underlying anatomy. Yet how the organization of white matter architecture constrains how the brain transitions from one cognitive state to another remains unknown. Here we address this question from a computational perspective by defining a brain state as a pattern of activity across brain regions. Drawing on recent advances in network control theory, we model the underlying mechanisms of brain state transitions as elicited by the collective control of region sets. Specifically, we examine how the brain moves from a specified initial state (characterized by high activity in the default mode) to a specified target state (characterized by high activity in primary sensorimotor cortex) in finite time. Across all state transitions, we observe that the supramarginal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule consistently acted as efficient, low energy control hubs, consistent with their strong anatomical connections to key input areas of sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, both these and other regions in the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and attention systems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot easily be classified by traditional notions of control common in the engineering literature. This theoretical versatility comes with a vulnerability to injury. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, we observe a loss of specificity in putative control processes, suggesting greater susceptibility to damage-induced noise in neurophysiological activity. These results offer fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms driving brain state transitions in healthy cognition and their alteration following injury.},

abstract = {Integrative analysis of multiple data types can take advantage of their complementary information and therefore may provide higher power to identify potential biomarkers that would be missed using individual data analysis. Due to different natures of diverse data modality, data integration is challenging. Here we address the data integration problem by developing a generalized sparse model (GSM) using weighting factors to integrate multi-modality data for biomarker selection. As an example, we applied the GSM model to a joint analysis of two types of schizophrenia data sets: 759,075 SNPs and 153,594 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) voxels in 208 subjects (92 cases/116 controls). To solve this small-sample-large-variable problem, we developed a novel sparse representation based variable selection (SRVS) algorithm, with the primary aim to identify biomarkers associated with schizophrenia. To validate the effectiveness of the selected variables, we performed multivariate classification followed by a ten-fold cross validation. We compared our proposed SRVS algorithm with an earlier sparse model based variable selection algorithm for integrated analysis. In addition, we compared with the traditional statistics method for uni-variant data analysis (Chi-squared test for SNP data and ANOVA for fMRI data). Results showed that our proposed SRVS method can identify novel biomarkers that show stronger capability in distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. Moreover, better classification ratios were achieved using biomarkers from both types of data, suggesting the importance of integrative analysis.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a hybrid machine learning method to classify schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The method consists of four stages: (1) SNPs with the most discriminating information between the healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are selected to construct a support vector machine ensemble (SNP-SVME). (2) Voxels in the fMRI map contributing to classification are selected to build another SVME (Voxel-SVME). (3) Components of fMRI activation obtained with independent component analysis (ICA) are used to construct a single SVM classifier (ICA-SVMC). (4) The above three models are combined into a single module using a majority voting approach to make a final decision (Combined SNP-fMRI). The method was evaluated by a fully validated leave-one-out method using 40 subjects (20 patients and 20 controls). The classification accuracy was: 0.74 for SNP-SVME, 0.82 for Voxel-SVME, 0.83 for ICA-SVMC, and 0.87 for Combined SNP-fMRI. Experimental results show that better classification accuracy was achieved by combining genetic and fMRI data than using either alone, indicating that genetic and brain function representing different, but partially complementary aspects, of schizophrenia etiopathology. This study suggests an effective way to reassess biological classification of individuals with schizophrenia, which is also potentially useful for identifying diagnostically important markers for the disorder.},

abstract = {Multimodal brain imaging data have shown increasing utility in answering both scientifically interesting and clinically relevant questions. Each brain imaging technique provides a different view of brain function or structure, while multimodal fusion capitalizes on the strength of each and may uncover hidden relationships that can merge findings from separate neuroimaging studies. However, most current approaches have focused on pair-wise fusion and there is still relatively little work on N-way data fusion and examination of the relationships among multiple data types. We recently developed an approach called "mCCA + jICA" as a novel multi-way fusion method which is able to investigate the disease risk factors that are either shared or distinct across multiple modalities as well as the full correspondence across modalities. In this paper, we applied this model to combine resting state fMRI (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, ALFF), gray matter (GM) density, and DTI (fractional anisotropy, FA) data, in order to elucidate the abnormalities underlying schizophrenia patients (SZs, n = 35) relative to healthy controls (HCs, n = 28). Both modality-common and modality-unique abnormal regions were identified in SZs, which were then used for successful classification for seven modality-combinations, showing the potential for a broad applicability of the mCCA + jICA model and its results. In addition, a pair of GM-DTI components showed significant correlation with the positive symptom subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), suggesting that GM density changes in default model network along with white-matter disruption in anterior thalamic radiation are associated with increased positive PANSS. Findings suggest the DTI anisotropy changes in frontal lobe may relate to the corresponding functional/structural changes in prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus that are thought to play a role in the clinical expression of SZ.},

Then the SRVS method was applied to an integrative analysis of two different SCZ data sets, a Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set and a functional resonance imaging (fMRI) data set, including 92 cases and 116 controls.

abstract = {Multimodal fusion is an effective approach to better understand brain diseases. However, most such instances have been limited to pair-wise fusion; because there are often more than two imaging modalities available per subject, there is a need for approaches that can combine multiple datasets optimally. In this paper, we extended our previous two-way fusion model called "multimodal CCA + joint ICA", to three or N-way fusion, that enables robust identification of correspondence among N data types and allows one to investigate the important question of whether certain disease risk factors are shared or distinct across multiple modalities. We compared "mCCA + jICA" with its alternatives in a 3-way fusion simulation and verified its advantages in both decomposition accuracy and modal linkage detection. We also applied it to real functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and structural MRI fusion to elucidate the abnormal architecture underlying schizophrenia (n = 97) relative to healthy controls (n = 116). Both modality-common and modality-unique abnormal regions were identified in schizophrenia. Specifically, the visual cortex in fMRI, the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) and forceps minor in DTI, and the parietal lobule, cuneus and thalamus in sMRI were linked and discriminated between patients and controls. One fMRI component with regions of activity in motor cortex and superior temporal gyrus individually discriminated schizophrenia from controls. Finally, three components showed significant correlation with duration of illness (DOI), suggesting that lower gray matter volumes in parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes and cerebellum are associated with increased DOI, along with white matter disruption in ATR and cortico-spinal tracts. Findings suggest that the identified fractional anisotropy changes may relate to the corresponding functional/structural changes in the brain that are thought to play a role in the clinical expression of schizophrenia. The proposed "mCCA + jICA" method showed promise for elucidating the joint or coupled neuronal abnormalities underlying mental illnesses and improves our understanding of the disease process. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has led to major changes in how fMRI data are analyzed and interpreted. Many studies now report both MVPA results and results from standard univariate voxel-wise analysis, often with the goal of drawing different conclusions from each. Because MVPA results can be sensitive to latent multidimensional representations and processes whereas univariate voxel-wise analysis cannot, one conclusion that is often drawn when MVPA and univariate results differ is that the activation patterns underlying MVPA results contain a multidimensional code. In the current study, we conducted simulations to formally test this assumption. Our findings reveal that MVPA tests are sensitive to the magnitude of voxel-level variability in the effect of a condition within subjects, even when the same linear relationship is coded in all voxels. We also find that MVPA is insensitive to subject-level variability in mean activation across an ROI, which is the primary variance component of interest in many standard univariate tests. Together, these results illustrate that differences between MVPA and univariate tests do not afford conclusions about the nature or dimensionality of the neural code. Instead, targeted tests of the informational content and/or dimensionality of activation patterns are critical for drawing strong conclusions about the representational codes that are indicated by significant MVPA results. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Most mental functions are associated with dynamic interactions within functional brain networks. Thus, training individuals to alter functional brain networks might provide novel and powerful means to improve cognitive performance and emotions. Using a novel connectivity-neurofeedback approach based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show for the first time that participants can learn to change functional brain networks. Specifically, we taught participants control over a key component of the emotion regulation network, in that they learned to increase top-down connectivity from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in cognitive control, onto the amygdala, which is involved in emotion processing. After training, participants successfully self-regulated the top-down connectivity between these brain areas even without neurofeedback, and this was associated with concomitant increases in subjective valence ratings of emotional stimuli of the participants. Connectivity-based neurofeedback goes beyond previous neurofeedback approaches, which were limited to training localized activity within a brain region. It allows to noninvasively and nonpharmacologically change interconnected functional brain networks directly, thereby resulting in specific behavioral changes. Our results demonstrate that connectivity-based neurofeedback training of emotion regulation networks enhances emotion regulation capabilities. This approach can potentially lead to powerful therapeutic emotion regulation protocols for neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Finite rate of innovation (FRI) is a recent framework for sampling and reconstruction of a large class of parametric signals that are characterized by finite number of innovations (parameters) per unit interval. In the absence of noise, exact recovery of FRI signals has been demonstrated. In the noisy scenario, there exist techniques to deal with non-ideal measurements. Yet, the accuracy and resiliency to noise and model mismatch are still challenging problems for real-world applications. We address the reconstruction of FRI signals, specifically a stream of Diracs, from few signal samples degraded by noise and we propose a new FRI reconstruction method that is based on a model-fitting approach related to the structured-TLS problem. The model-fitting method is based on minimizing the training error, that is, the error between the computed and the recovered moments (i.e., the FRI-samples of the signal), subject to an annihilation system. We present our framework for three different constraints of the annihilation system. Moreover, we propose a model order selection framework to determine the innovation rate of the signal; i.e., the number of Diracs by estimating the noise level through the training error curve. We compare the performance of the model-fitting approach with known FRI reconstruction algorithms and Cramér-Rao's lower bound (CRLB) to validate these contributions.},

Any available information should be exploited to increase the power of detecting true between-group effects. We present an adaptive strategy that exploits the data structure and the prior information concerning positive dependence between nodes and connections, without relying on strong assumptions. As a first step, we decompose the brain network, i.e., the connectome, into subnetworks and we apply a screening at the subnetwork level. The subnetworks are defined either according to prior knowledge or by applying a data driven algorithm. Given the results of the screening step, a filtering is performed to seek real differences at the node/connection level. The proposed strategy could be used to strongly control either the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate. We show by means of different simulations the benefit of the proposed strategy, and we present a real application of comparing connectomes of preschool children and adolescents.},

abstract = {Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback is used as a tool to gain voluntary control of activity in various brain regions. Little emphasis has been put on the influence of cognitive and personality traits on neurofeedback efficacy and baseline activity. Here, we assessed the effect of individual pain coping on rt-fMRI neurofeedback during heat-induced pain. Twenty-eight healthy subjects completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) prior to scanning. The first part of the fMRI experiment identified target regions using painful heat stimulation. Then, subjects were asked to down-regulate the pain target brain region during four neurofeedback runs with painful heat stimulation. Functional MRI analysis included correlation analysis between fMRI activation and pain ratings as well as CSQ ratings. At the behavioral level, the active pain coping (first principal component of CSQ) was correlated with pain ratings during neurofeedback. Concerning neuroimaging, pain sensitive regions were negatively correlated with pain coping. During neurofeedback, the pain coping was positively correlated with activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and visual cortex. Thermode temperature was negatively correlated with anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation. In conclusion, self-reported pain coping mechanisms and pain sensitivity are a source of variance during rt-fMRI neurofeedback possibly explaining variations in regulation success. In particular, active coping seems to be associated with successful pain regulation.},

abstract = {Functional brain networks reconfigure spontaneously during rest. Such network dynamics can be studied by dynamic functional connectivity (dynFC); i.e., sliding-window correlations between regional brain activity. Key parameters-such as window length and cut-off frequencies for filtering-are not yet systematically studied. In this letter we provide the fundamental theory from signal processing to address these parameter choices when estimating and interpreting dynFC. We guide the reader through several illustrative cases, both simple analytical models and experimental fMRI BOLD data. First, we show how spurious fluctuations in dynFC can arise due to the estimation method when the window length is shorter than the largest wavelength present in both signals, even for deterministic signals with a fixed relationship. Second, we study how real fluctuations of dynFC can be explained using a frequency-based view, which is particularly instructive for signals with multiple frequency components such as fMRI BOLD, demonstrating that fluctuations in sliding-window correlation emerge by interaction between frequency components similar to the phenomenon of beat frequencies. We conclude with practical guidelines for the choice and impact of the window length.},

abstract = {A graph based framework for fMRI brain activation mapping is presented. The approach exploits the spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT) for the purpose of defining an advanced multi-resolutional spatial transformation for fMRI data. The framework extends wavelet based SPM (WSPM), which is an alternative to the conventional approach of statistical parametric mapping (SPM), and is developed specifically for group-level analysis. We present a novel procedure for constructing brain graphs, with subgraphs that separately encode the structural connectivity of the cerebral and cerebellar gray matter (GM), and address the inter-subject GM variability by the use of template GM representations. Graph wavelets tailored to the convoluted boundaries of GM are then constructed as a means to implement a GM-based spatial transformation on fMRI data. The proposed approach is evaluated using real as well as semi-synthetic multi-subject data. Compared to SPM and WSPM using classical wavelets, the proposed approach shows superior type-I error control. The results on real data suggest a higher detection sensitivity as well as the capability to capture subtle, connected patterns of brain activity.},

abstract = {Spatial variability in resting functional MRI (fMRI) brain networks has not been well studied in schizophrenia, a disease known for both neurodevelopmental and widespread anatomic changes. Motivated by abundant evidence of neuroanatomical variability from previous studies of schizophrenia, we draw upon a relatively new approach called independent vector analysis (IVA) to assess this variability in resting fMRI networks. IVA is a blind-source separation algorithm, which segregates fMRI data into temporally coherent but spatially independent networks and has been shown to be especially good at capturing spatial variability among subjects in the extracted networks. We introduce several new ways to quantify differences in variability of IVA-derived networks between schizophrenia patients (SZs = 82) and healthy controls (HCs = 89). Voxelwise amplitude analyses showed significant group differences in the spatial maps of auditory cortex, the basal ganglia, the sensorimotor network, and visual cortex. Tests for differences (HC-SZ) in the spatial variability maps suggest, that at rest, SZs exhibit more activity within externally focused sensory and integrative network and less activity in the default mode network thought to be related to internal reflection. Additionally, tests for difference of variance between groups further emphasize that SZs exhibit greater network variability. These results, consistent with our prediction of increased spatial variability within SZs, enhance our understanding of the disease and suggest that it is not just the amplitude of connectivity that is different in schizophrenia, but also the consistency in spatial connectivity patterns across subjects.},

abstract = {Relating measures of electroencephalography (EEG) back to the underlying sources is a long-standing inverse problem. Here we propose a new method to estimate the EEG sources of identified electrophysiological states that represent spontaneous activity, or are evoked by a stimulus, or caused by disease or disorder. Our method has the unique advantage of seamlessly integrating a statistical significance of the source estimate while efficiently eliminating artifacts (e.g., due to eye blinks, eye movements, bad electrodes).After determining the electrophysiological states in terms of stable topographies using established methods (e.g.: ICA, PCA, k-means, epoch average), we propose to estimate these states' time courses through spatial regression of a General Linear Model (GLM). These time courses are then used to find EEG sources that have a similar time-course (using temporal regression of a second GLM).We validate our method using both simulated and experimental data. Simulated data allows us to assess the difference between source maps obtained by the proposed method and those obtained by applying conventional source imaging of the state topographies. Moreover, we use data from 7 epileptic patients (9 distinct epileptic foci localized by intracranial EEG) and 2 healthy subjects performing an eyes-open/eyes-closed task to elicit activity in the alpha frequency range.Our results indicate that the proposed EEG source imaging method accurately localizes the sources for each of the electrical brain states. Furthermore, our method is particularly suited for estimating the sources of EEG resting states or otherwise weak spontaneous activity states, a problem not adequately solved before. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The fetal origin of the posterior cerebral artery (fPCA) is a frequent vascular variant in 11-29{\%} of the population. For the fPCA, blood flow in the PCA originates from the anterior instead of the posterior circulation. We tested whether this blood supply variant impacts the cerebral blood flow assessed by arterial spin labeling (ASL), cerebrovascular reserve as well as resting-state static functional connectivity (sFC) in the sense of a systematic confound. METHODS The study included 385 healthy, elderly subjects (mean age: 74.18 years [range: 68.9-90.4]; 243 female). Participants were classified into normal vascular supply (n = 296, 76.88{\%}), right fetal origin (n = 23, 5.97{\%}), left fetal origin (n = 16, 4.16{\%}), bilateral fetal origin (n = 4, 1.04{\%}), and intermediate (n = 46, 11.95{\%}, excluded from further analysis) groups. ASL-derived relative cerebral blood flow (relCBF) maps and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) maps derived from a CO2 challenge with blocks of 7{\%} CO2 were compared. Additionally, sFC between 90 regions of interest (ROIs) was compared between the groups. RESULTS CVR was significantly reduced in subjects with ipsilateral fPCA, most prominently in the temporal lobe. ASL yielded a non-significant trend towards reduced relCBF in bilateral posterior watershed areas. In contrast, conventional atlas-based sFC did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, fPCA presence may bias the assessment of cerebrovascular reserve by reducing the response to CO2. In contrast, its effect on ASL-assessed baseline perfusion was marginal. Moreover, fPCA presence did not systematically impact resting-state sFC. Taken together, this data implies that perfusion variables should take into account the vascularization patterns.},

abstract = {Emotion processing deficits are prominent in schizophrenia and exist prior to the onset of overt psychosis. However, developmental trajectories of neural circuitry subserving emotion regulation and the role that they may play in illness onset have not yet been examined in patients at risk for psychosis. The present study employed a cross-sectional analysis to examine age-related functional activation in amygdala and prefrontal cortex, as well as functional connectivity between these regions, in adolescents at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis relative to typically developing adolescents. Participants (n = 34) performed an emotion processing fMRI task, including emotion labeling, emotion matching, and non-emotional control conditions. Regression analyses were used to predict activation in the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) based on age, group, sex, and the interaction of age by group. CHR adolescents exhibited altered age-related variation in amygdala and vlPFC activation, relative to controls. Controls displayed decreased amygdala and increased vlPFC activation with age, while patients exhibited the opposite pattern (increased amygdala and decreased vlPFC activation), suggesting a failure of prefrontal cortex to regulate amygdala reactivity. Moreover, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed decreased amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity among CHR adolescents, consistent with disrupted brain connectivity as a vulnerability factor in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the at-risk syndrome is marked by abnormal development and functional connectivity of neural systems subserving emotion regulation. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm aberrant developmental trajectories intra-individually and to examine whether these abnormalities are predictive of conversion to psychosis, and of later deficits in socioemotional functioning. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, but whether the adolescent period, proximal to onset, is associated with aberrant development in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis is incompletely understood. While abnormal gray and white matter development has been observed, alterations in functional neuroimaging (fMRI) parameters during adolescence as related to conversion to psychosis have not yet been investigated. Twenty CHR individuals and 19 typically developing controls (TDC), (ages 14-21), were recruited from the Center for Assessment and Prevention of Prodromal States (CAPPS) at UCLA. Participants performed a Sternberg-style verbal working memory (WMem) task during fMRI and data were analyzed using a cross-sectional design to test the hypothesis that there is a deviant developmental trajectory in WMem associated neural circuitry in those at risk for psychosis. Eight of the CHR adolescents converted to psychosis within 2 years of initial assessment. A voxel-wise regression examining the relationship between age and activation revealed a significant group-by-age interaction. TDC showed a negative association between age and functional activation in the WMem circuitry while CHR adolescents showed a positive association. Moreover, CHR patients who later converted to overt psychosis showed a distinct pattern of abnormal age-associated activation in the frontal cortex relative to controls, while non-converters showed a more diffuse posterior pattern. Finding that age related variation in baseline patterns of neural activity differentiate individuals who subsequently convert to psychosis from healthy subjects suggests that these differences are likely to be clinically relevant. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

It focuses on the analysis of the spatial properties of these fields and on quantitative assessment of changes of field topographies across time, experimental conditions, or populations. Topographic analyses are advantageous because they are reference independents and thus render statistically unambiguous results. Neurophysiologically, differences in topography directly indicate changes in the configuration of the active neuronal sources in the brain. We describe global measures of field strength and field similarities, temporal segmentation based on topographic variations, topographic analysis in the frequency domain, topographic statistical analysis, and source imaging based on distributed inverse solutions. All analysis methods are implemented in a freely available academic software package called CARTOOL. Besides providing these analysis tools, CARTOOL is particularly designed to visualize the data and the analysis results using 3-dimensional display routines that allow rapid manipulation and animation of 3D images. CARTOOL therefore is a helpful tool for researchers as well as for clinicians to interpret multichannel EEG and evoked potentials in a global, comprehensive, and unambiguous way.},

abstract = {Structural brain abnormalities are central to schizophrenia (SZ), but it remains unknown whether they are linked to dysmaturational processes crossing diagnostic boundaries, aggravating across disease stages, and driving the neurodi-agnostic signature of the illness. Therefore, we investigated whether patients with SZ (N = 141), major depression (MD; N = 104), borderline personality disorder (BPD; N = 57), and individuals in at-risk mental states for psycho-sis (ARMS; N = 89) deviated from the trajectory of normal brain maturation. This deviation was measured as differ-ence between chronological and the neuroanatomical age (brain age gap estimation [BrainAGE]). Neuroanatomical age was determined by a machine learning system trained to individually estimate age from the structural magnetic resonance imagings of 800 healthy controls. Group-level analyses showed that BrainAGE was highest in SZ (+5.5 y) group, followed by MD (+4.0), BPD (+3.1), and the ARMS (+1.7) groups. Earlier disease onset in MD and BPD groups correlated with more pronounced BrainAGE, reaching effect sizes of the SZ group. Second, BrainAGE increased across at-risk, recent onset, and recurrent states of SZ. Finally, BrainAGE predicted both patient status as well as negative and disorganized symptoms. These find-ings suggest that an individually quantifiable " accelerated aging " effect may particularly impact on the neuroanatom-ical signature of SZ but may extend also to other mental disorders.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging-based functional connectivity (FC) analyses have revealed significant developmental trends in specific intrinsic connectivity networks linked to cognitive and behavioral maturation. However, knowledge of how brain functional maturation is associated with FC dynamics at rest is limited. Here, we examined age-related differences in the temporal variability of FC dynamics with data publicly released by the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI; n = 183, ages 7–30) and showed that dynamic inter- region interactions can be used to accurately predict individual brain maturity across development. Furthermore, we identified a significant age-dependent trend underlying dynamic inter-network FC, including increasing variability of the connections between the visual network, default mode network (DMN) and cerebellum as well as within the cerebellum and DMN and decreasing variability within the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and DMN as well as the cingulo-opercular network. Overall, the results suggested significant developmental changes in dynamic inter-network interaction, which may shed new light on the functional organization of typical developmental brains},

abstract = {Individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis have become a major focus for research designed to explore markers for early detection of and clinical intervention in schizophrenia. In particular, structural magnetic resonance imaging studies in UHR individuals have provided important insight into the neurobiological basis of psychosis and have shown the brain changes associated with clinical risk factors. In this review, we describe the structural brain abnormalities in magnetic resonance images in UHR individuals. The current accumulated data demonstrate that abnormalities in the prefrontal and temporal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex occur before illness onset. These regions are compatible with the regions of structural deficits found in schizophrenia and first-episode patients. In addition, the burgeoning evidence suggests that such structural abnormalities are potential markers for the transition to psychosis. However, most findings to date are limited because they are from cross-sectional rather than longitudinal studies. Recently, researchers have emphasized neurodevelopmental considerations with respect to brain structural alterations in UHR individuals. Future studies should be conducted to characterize the differences in the brain developmental trajectory between UHR individuals and healthy controls using a longitudinal design. These new studies should contribute to early detection and management as well as provide more predictive markers of later psychosis.},

Such networks have been consistently identified across subjects using spatial ICA (independent component analysis). Moreover, graph theory-based network analyses have also been applied to resting-state fMRI data, identifying similar RSNs, although typically at a coarser spatial resolution. In this work, we examined resting-state fMRI networks from 194 subjects at a voxel-level resolution, and examined the consistency of RSNs across subjects using a metric called scaled inclusivity (SI), which summarizes consistency of modular partitions across networks. Our SI analyses indicated that some RSNs are robust across subjects, comparable to the corresponding RSNs identified by ICA. We also found that some commonly reported RSNs are less consistent across subjects. This is the first direct comparison of RSNs between ICAs and graph-based network analyses at a comparable resolution.},

abstract = {A variety of imaging, neuropsychological, and genetic biomarkers have been suggested as potential biomarkers for the identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients who later develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we systematically evaluated the most promising combinations of these biomarkers regarding discrimination between stable and converter MCI and reflection of disease staging. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data of AD (n = 144), controls (n = 112), stable (n = 265) and converter (n = 177) MCI, for which apolipoprotein E status, neuropsychological evaluation, and structural, glucose, and amyloid imaging were available, were included in this study. Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers were built on AD and controls data for all possible combinations of these biomarkers, with and without stratification by amyloid status. All classifiers were then applied to the MCI cohorts. We obtained an accuracy of 76{\%} for discrimination between converter and stable MCI with glucose positron emission tomography as a single biomarker. This accuracy increased to about 87{\%} when including further imaging modalities and genetic information. We also identified several biomarker combinations as strong predictors of time to conversion. Use of amyloid validated training data resulted in increased sensitivities and decreased specificities for differentiation between stable and converter MCI when amyloid was included as a biomarker but not for other classifier combinations. Our results indicate that fully independent classifiers built only on AD and controls data and combining imaging, genetic, and/or neuropsychological biomarkers can more reliably discriminate between stable and converter MCI than single modality classifiers. Several biomarker combinations are identified as strongly predictive for the time to conversion to AD.},

abstract = {A growing field of research explores links between behavioral measures and functional connectivity (FC) assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies suggest that measurement of these relationships may be corrupted by head motion artifact. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we find that a surprising number of behavioral, demographic, and physiological measures (23 of 122), including fluid intelligence, reading ability, weight, and psychiatric diagnostic scales, correlate with head motion. We demonstrate that “trait” (across-subject) and “state” (across-day, within-subject) effects of motion on FC are remarkably similar in HCP data, suggesting that state effects of motion could potentially mimic trait correlates of behavior. Thus, head motion is a likely source of systematic errors (bias) in the measurement of FC:behavior relationships. Next, we show that data cleaning strategies reduce the influence of head motion and substantially alter previously reported FC:behavior relationship. Our results suggest that spurious relationships mediated by head motion may be widespread in studies linking FC to behavior.},

Its goal is to predict a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors. This prediction is achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors called latent variables which have the best predictive power. These latent variables can be used to create displays akin to PCA displays. The quality of the prediction obtained from a PLS regression model is evaluated with cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and jackknife. There are two main variants of PLS regression: The most common one separates the roles of dependent and independent variables; the second one—used mostly to analyze brain imaging data—gives the same roles to dependent and independent variables .},

There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem.

abstract = {Studies of brain-wide functional connectivity or structural covariance typically use measures like the Pearson correlation coefficient, applied to data that have been averaged across voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). However, averaging across voxels may result in biased connectivity estimates when there is inhomogeneity within those ROIs, e.g., sub-regions that exhibit different patterns of functional connectivity or structural covariance. Here, we propose a new measure based on “distance correlation”; a test of multivariate dependence of high dimensional vectors, which allows for both linear and non-linear dependencies. We used simulations to show how distance correlation out-performs Pearson correlation in the face of inhomogeneous ROIs. To evaluate this new measure on real data, we use resting-state fMRI scans and T1 structural scans from 2 sessions on each of 214 participants from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing {\&} Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project. Pearson correlation and distance correlation showed similar average connectivity patterns, for both functional connectivity and structural covariance. Nevertheless, distance correlation was shown to be 1) more reliable across sessions, 2) more similar across participants, and 3) more robust to different sets of ROIs. Moreover, we found that the similarity between functional connectivity and structural covariance estimates was higher for distance correlation compared to Pearson correlation. We also explored the relative effects of different preprocessing options and motion artefacts on functional connectivity. Because distance correlation is easy to implement and fast to compute, it is a promising alternative to Pearson correlations for investigating ROI-based brain-wide connectivity patterns, for functional as well as structural data.},

@article{Kang2012,
abstract = {The goal of this article is to model cognitive control related activation among predefined regions of interest (ROIs) of the human brain while properly adjusting for the underlying spatio-temporal correlations. Standard approaches to fMRI analysis do not simultaneously take into account both the spatial and temporal correlations that are prevalent in fMRI data. This is primarily due to the computational complexity of estimating the spatio-temporal covariance matrix. More specifically, they do not take into account multiscale spatial correlation (between-ROIs and within-ROI). To address these limitations, we propose a spatio-spectral mixed-effects model. Working in the spectral domain simplifies the temporal covariance structure because the Fourier coefficients are approximately uncorrelated across frequencies. Additionally, by incorporating voxel-specific and ROI-specific random effects, the model is able to capture the multiscale spatial covariance structure: distance-dependent local correlation (within an ROI), and distance-independent global correlation (between-ROIs). Building on existing theory on linear mixed-effects models to conduct estimation and inference, we applied our model to fMRI data to study activation in prespecified ROIs in the prefontal cortex and estimate the correlation structure in the network. Simulation studies demonstrate that ignoring the multiscale correlation leads to higher false positive error rates.},

Magnetic resonance images were collected in a sample of 45 primates including 8 New World monkeys, 10 Old World monkeys, 4 lesser apes, 17 great apes, and 6 humans. CC:VOL and CC:NEO were determined and correlated with measures of brain asymmetry. The results indicate that brain asymmetry significantly predicted CC:VOL and CC:NEO. Subsequent analyses revealed that species variation in functional asymmetries in the form of handedness are also inversely related to CC:NEO. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that leftward brain asymmetries may have evolved as a consequence of reduced interhemispheric connectivity.},

In the present study, a new method was developed based on the regional homogeneity (ReHo), in which KCC was used to measure the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of its nearest neighbors in a voxel-wise way. Six healthy subjects performed left and right finger movement tasks in event-related design; five of them were additionally scanned in a rest condition. KCC was compared among the three conditions (left finger movement, right finger movement, and the rest). Results show that bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) had higher KCC in either left or right finger movement condition than in rest condition. Contrary to prediction and to activation pattern, KCC of ipsilateral M1 is significantly higher than contralateral M1 in unilateral finger movement conditions. These results support the previous electrophysiologic findings of increasing ipsilateral M1 excitation during unilateral movement. ReHo can consider as a complementary method to model-driven method, and it could help reveal the complexity of the human brain function. More work is needed to understand the neural mechanism underlying ReHo.},

Here we show that support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis extracts sufficient information from fcMRI data to make accurate predictions about individuals' brain maturity across development. The use of only 5 minutes of resting-state fcMRI data from 238 scans of typically developing volunteers (ages 7 to 30 years) allowed prediction of individual brain maturity as a functional connectivity maturation index. The resultant functional maturation curve accounted for 55{\%} of the sample variance and followed a nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape. The greatest relative contribution to predicting individual brain maturity was made by the weakening of short-range functional connections between the adult brain's major functional networks.},

abstract = {We introduce a mass-univariate framework for the analysis of whole-brain structural trajectories using longitudinal Voxel-Based Morphometry data and Bayesian inference. Our approach to developmental and aging longitudinal studies characterizes heterogeneous structural growth/decline between and within groups. In particular, we propose a probabilistic generative model that parameterizes individual and ensemble average changes in brain structure using linear mixed-effects models of age and subject-specific covariates. Model inversion uses Expectation Maximization (EM), while voxelwise (empirical) priors on the size of individual differences are estimated from the data. Bayesian inference on individual and group trajectories is realized using Posterior Probability Maps (PPM). In addition to parameter inference, the framework affords comparisons of models with varying combinations of model order for fixed and random effects using model evidence. We validate the model in simulations and real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. We further demonstrate how subject specific characteristics contribute to individual differences in longitudinal volume changes in healthy subjects, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).},

@article{Bilgel2016,
abstract = {It is important to characterize the temporal trajectories of disease-related biomarkers in order to monitor progression and identify potential points of intervention. These are especially important for neurodegenerative diseases, as therapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the preclinical disease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. Neuroimaging allows for the measurement of structural, functional, and metabolic integrity of the brain at the level of voxels, whose volumes are on the order of mm(3). These voxelwise measurements provide a rich collection of disease indicators. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies enable the analysis of changes in these voxelwise measures. However, commonly used longitudinal analysis approaches, such as linear mixed effects models, do not account for the fact that individuals enter a study at various disease stages and progress at different rates, and generally consider each voxelwise measure independently. We propose a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for estimating the trajectories of voxelwise neuroimaging biomarkers from longitudinal data that accounts for such differences across individuals. The method involves the prediction of a progression score for each visit based on a collective analysis of voxelwise biomarker data within an expectation-maximization framework that efficiently handles large amounts of measurements and variable number of visits per individual, and accounts for spatial correlations among voxels. This score allows individuals with similar progressions to be aligned and analyzed together, which enables the construction of a trajectory of brain changes as a function of an underlying progression or disease stage. We apply our method to studying cortical $\beta$-amyloid deposition, a hallmark of preclinical Alzheimer's disease, as measured using positron emission tomography. Results on 104 individuals with a total of 300 visits suggest that precuneus is the earliest cortical region to accumulate amyloid, closely followed by the cingulate and frontal cortices, then by the lateral parietal cortex. The extracted progression scores reveal a pattern similar to mean cortical distribution volume ratio (DVR), an index of global brain amyloid levels. The proposed method can be applied to other types of longitudinal imaging data, including metabolism, blood flow, tau, and structural imaging-derived measures, to extract individualized summary scores indicating disease progression and to provide voxelwise trajectories that can be compared between brain regions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical differentiation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is challenging due to overlapping clinical features at presentation. While diagnostic criteria for both disorders incorporate evidence of frontal and temporal cortical atrophy, understanding of the progression of atrophy in these disorders is limited. This study aimed to elucidate common and disease specific progressive changes in cortical and subcortical brain structures in AD and bvFTD. METHODS: Forty-one AD, 37 bvFTD and 33 healthy controls underwent baseline MRI and of these longitudinal follow-up was obtained for 20AD and 20 bvFTD (one to four years). A total of 87AD and 70 bvFTD consecutive scans were included in the study. The trajectories of progression in cortical and subcortical structures were identified with Freesurfer and Linear Mixed Effect modelling. RESULTS: The results uncovered cortical and subcortical disease-specific trajectories of neurodegeneration in AD and bvFTD. Specifically, direct comparisons between patients groups revealed that over time AD showed greater cortical atrophy in the inferior parietal and posterior cingulate cortex than bvFTD. Conversely, bvFTD patients showed greater atrophy in the striatum than AD over time. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that atrophy in the posterior cingulate and the striatum diverge with disease progression in these dementia syndromes and may represent a potential diagnostic biomarker for tracking rates of progression of AD and bvFTD. These findings may help inform future drug trials by identifying appropriate outcome measures to quantify drug efficacy and their ability to modulate disease progression over time.},

abstract = {Childhood psychiatric disorders are rarely static; rather they change over time and longitudinal studies are ideally suited to capture such dynamic processes. Using longitudinal data, insights can be gained into the nature of the perturbation away from the trajectory of typical development in childhood disorders. Thus, some disorders may reflect a delay in neurodevelopmental trajectories. Our studies in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest that cortical development is delayed with a rightward shift along the age axis in cortical trajectories, most prominent in prefrontal cortical regions. Other disorders may be characterized by differences in the velocity of trajectories: the basic shape of neurodevelopmental curves remains intact, but with disrupted tempo. Thus, childhood onset schizophrenia is associated with a marked increase during adolescence in the velocity of loss of cerebral gray matter. By contrast, in childhood autism there is an early acceleration of brain growth, which overshoots typical dimensions leading to transient cerebral enlargement. Finally, there may be more profound deviations from typical neurodevelopment, with a complete "derailing" of brain growth and a loss of the features which characterize typical brain development. An example is the almost complete silencing of white matter growth during adolescence of patients with childhood onset schizophrenia. Adopting a longitudinal perspective also readily lends itself to the understanding of the neural bases of differential clinical outcomes. Again taking ADHD as an example, we found that remission is associated with convergence to the template of typical development, whereas persistence is accompanied by progressive divergence away from typical trajectories.},

abstract = {Dopamine (DA) losses are associated with various aging-related cognitive deficits. Typically, higher moment-to-moment brain signal variability in large-scale patterns of voxels in neocortical regions is linked to better cognitive performance and younger adult age, yet the physiological mechanisms regulating brain signal variability are unknown. We explored the relationship among adult age, DA availability, and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability, while younger and older participants performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task. We quantified striatal and extrastriatal DA D1 receptor density with [(11)C]SCH23390 and positron emission tomography in all participants. We found that BOLD variability in a neocortical region was negatively related to age and positively related to SWM performance. In contrast, BOLD variability in subcortical regions and bilateral hippocampus was positively related to age and slower responses, and negatively related to D1 density in caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, BOLD variability in neocortical regions was positively associated with task-related disengagement of the default-mode network, a network whose activation needs to be suppressed for efficient SWM processing. Our results show that age-related DA losses contribute to changes in brain signal variability in subcortical regions and suggest a potential mechanism, by which neocortical BOLD variability supports cognitive performance.},

Here, we use 376 longitudinally acquired structural brain scans from 108 typically developing adolescents to conduct the first study of coordinated anatomical change within the developing cortex. Correlation in rates of anatomical change was regionally heterogeneous, with fronto-temporal association cortices showing the strongest and most widespread maturational coupling with other cortical areas, and lower-order sensory cortices showing the least. Canonical cortical systems with rich structural and functional interconnectivity showed significantly elevated maturational coupling. Evidence for sexually dimorphic maturational coupling was found within a frontopolar-centered prefrontal system involved in complex decision-making. By providing the first link between cortical connectivity and the coordination of cortical development, we reveal a hitherto unseen property of healthy brain maturation, which may represent a target for neurodevelopmental disease processes, and a substrate for sexually dimorphic behavior in adolescence. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Localization of the neural generators of the human oddball response remains challenging due to the lack of a single imaging technique with good spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we use independent component analyses to fuse ERP and fMRI modalities in order to examine the dynamics of the auditory oddball response with high spatiotemporal resolution across the entire brain. Initial activations in auditory and motor planning regions are followed by auditory association cortex and motor execution regions. The P3 response is associated with brainstem, temporal lobe, and medial frontal activity and finally a late temporal lobe "evaluative" response.

abstract = {Background: Delineation of the cortical anomalies underpinning attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can powerfully inform pathophysiological models. We previously found that ADHD is characterized by a delayed maturation of prefrontal cortical thickness. We now ask if this extends to the maturation of cortical surface area and gyrification. Methods: Two hundred thirty-four children with ADHD and 231 typically developing children participated in the study, with 837 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally. We defined the developmental trajectories of cortical surfaces and gyrification and the sequence of cortical maturation, as indexed by the age at which each cortical vertex attained its peak surface area. Results: In both groups, the maturation of cortical surface area progressed in centripetal waves, both lateral (starting at the central sulcus and frontopolar regions, sweeping toward the mid and superior frontal gyrus) and medial (descending down the medial prefrontal cortex, toward the cingulate gyrus). However, the surface area developmental trajectory was delayed in ADHD. For the right prefrontal cortex, the median age by which 50{\%} of cortical vertices attained peak area was 14.6 years (SE = .03) in ADHD, significantly later than in typically developing group at 12.7 years (SE = .03) [log-rank test $\chi$(1)2 = 1300, p {\textless} .00001]. Similar, but less pronounced, delay was found in the left hemispheric lobes. There were no such diagnostic differences in the developmental trajectories of cortical gyrification. Conclusions: The congruent delay in cortical thickness and surface area direct attention away from processes that selectively affect one cortical component toward mechanisms controlling the maturation of multiple cortical dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research often attributes blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variance to measurement-related confounds. However, what is typically considered "noise" variance in data may be a vital feature of brain function. We examined fMRI signal variability during fixation baseline periods, and then compared SD- and mean-based spatial patterns and their relations with chronological age (20-85 years). We found that not only was the SD-based pattern robust, it differed greatly, both spatially and statistically, from the mean-based pattern. Notably, the unique age-predictive power of the SD-based pattern was more than five times that of the mean-based pattern. This reliable SD-based pattern of activity highlights an important "signal" within what is often considered measurement-related "noise." We suggest that examination of BOLD signal variability may reveal a host of novel brain-related effects not previously considered in neuroimaging research.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework to extract the activity-related component in the BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal. As opposed to traditional fMRI signal analysis techniques, we do not impose any prior knowledge of the event timing. Instead, our basic assumption is that the activation pattern is a sequence of short and sparsely distributed stimuli, as is the case in slow event-related fMRI. We introduce new wavelet bases, termed activelets, which sparsify the activity-related BOLD signal. These wavelets mimic the behavior of the differential operator underlying the hemodynamic system. To recover the sparse representation, we deploy a sparse-solution search algorithm. The feasibility of the method is evaluated using both synthetic and experimental fMRI data. The importance of the activelet basis and the non-linear sparse recovery algorithm is demonstrated by comparison against classical B-spline wavelets and linear regularization, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this study, sparse modeling is introduced for the estimation of propagation patterns in intracardiac atrial fibrillation (AF) signals. The estimation is based on the partial directed coherence function, derived from fitting a multivariate autoregressive model to the observed signal using least-squares (LS) estimation. The propagation pattern analysis incorporates prior information on sparse coupling as well as the distance between the recording sites. Two optimization methods are employed for estimation of the model parameters, namely, the adaptive group least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (aLASSO), and a novel method named the distance-adaptive group LASSO (dLASSO). Using simulated data, both optimization methods were superior to LS estimation with respect to detection and estimation performance. The normalized error between the true and estimated model parameters dropped from 0.20 ± 0.04 for LS estimation to 0.03 ± 0.01 for both aLASSO and dLASSO when the number of available data samples exceeded the number of model parameters by a factor of 5. For shorter data segments, the error reduction was more pronounced and information on the distance gained in importance. Propagation pattern analysis was also studied on intracardiac AF data, the results showing that the identification of propagation patterns is substantially simplified by the sparsity assumption.},

It is commonly addressed at two complementary levels of description and analysis: the cellular/synaptic level (synaptic consolidation) and the brain systems level (systems consolidation). This article focuses on selected recent advances in consolidation research, including the reconsolidation of long-term memory items, the brain mechanisms of transformation of the content and of cue-dependency of memory items over time, as well as the role of rest and sleep in consolidating and shaping memories. Taken together, the picture that emerges is of dynamic engrams that are formed, modified, and remodified over time at the systems level by using synaptic consolidation mechanisms as subroutines. This implies that, contrary to interpretations that have dominated neuroscience for a while, but similar to long-standing cognitive concepts, consolidation of at least some items in long-term memory may never really come to an end.},

abstract = {Background Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists into adulthood in around half of those affected, constituting a major public health challenge. No known demographic, clinical, or neuropsychological factors robustly explain the clinical course, directing our focus to the brain. Herein, we link the trajectories of cerebral cortical development during childhood and adolescence with the severity of adult ADHD. Methods Using a longitudinal study design, 92 participants with ADHD had childhood (mean 10.7 years, SD 3.3) and adult clinical assessments (mean 23.8 years, SD 4.3) with repeated neuroanatomic magnetic resonance imaging. Contrast was made against 184 matched typically developing volunteers. Results Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder persisted in 37 (40{\%}) subjects and adult symptom severity was linked to cortical trajectories. Specifically, as the number of adult symptoms increased, particularly inattentive symptoms, so did the rate of cortical thinning in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. For each increase of one symptom of adult ADHD, the rate of cortical thinning increased by.0018 mm (SE =.0004, t = 4.2, p {\textless}.0001), representing a 5.6{\%} change over the mean rate of thinning for the entire group. These differing trajectories resulted in a convergence toward typical dimensions among those who remitted and a fixed, nonprogressive deficit in persistent ADHD. Notably, cortical thickening or minimal thinning (greater than -.007 mm/year) was found exclusively among individuals who remitted. Conclusions Adult ADHD status is linked with the developmental trajectories of cortical components of networks supporting attention, cognitive control, and the default mode network. This informs our understanding of the developmental pathways to adult ADHD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While there has been considerable concern over possible adverse effects of psychostimulants on brain development, this issue has not been examined in a prospective study. The authors sought to determine prospectively whether psychostimulant treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with differences in the development of the cerebral cortex during adolescence. METHOD: Change in cortical thickness was estimated from two neuroanatomic MRI scans in 43 youths with ADHD. The mean age at the first scan was 12.5 years, and at the second scan, 16.4 years. Nineteen patients not treated with psychostimulants between the scans were compared with an age-matched group of 24 patients who were treated with psychostimulants. Further comparison was made against a template derived from 620 scans of 294 typically developing youths without ADHD. RESULTS: Adolescents taking psychostimulants differed from those not taking psychostimulants in the rate of change of the cortical thickness in the right motor strip, the left middle/inferior frontal gyrus, and the right parieto-occipital region. The group difference was due to more rapid cortical thinning in the group not taking psychostimulants (mean cortical thinning of 0.16 mm/year [SD=0.17], compared with 0.03 mm/year [SD=0.11] in the group taking psychostimulants). Comparison against the typically developing cohort without ADHD showed that cortical thinning in the group not taking psychostimulants was in excess of age-appropriate rates. The treatment groups did not differ in clinical outcome, however. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show no evidence that psychostimulants were associated with slowing of overall growth of the cortical mantle.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been associated with a reduction in resting state functional connectivity, though this assertion has recently been challenged by reports of increased connectivity in ASD. To address these contradictory findings, we examined both inter- and intrahemispheric functional connectivity in several resting state data sets acquired from adults with high-functioning ASD and matched control participants. Our results reveal areas of both increased and decreased connectivity in multiple ASD groups as compared to control groups. We propose that this heterogeneity stems from a previously unrecognized ASD characteristic: idiosyncratic distortions of the functional connectivity pattern relative to the typical, canonical template. The magnitude of an individual's pattern distortion in homotopic interhemispheric connectivity correlated significantly with behavioral symptoms of ASD. We propose that individualized alterations in functional connectivity organization are a core characteristic of high-functioning ASD, and that this may account for previous discrepant findings.},

@article{Haufe2014,
abstract = {The increase in spatiotemporal resolution of neuroimaging devices is accompanied by a trend towards more powerful multivariate analysis methods. Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but complementary objectives require different analysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It was recently found that the development of typical patterns of prefrontal, but not posterior, cortical asymmetry is disrupted in right-handed youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using longitudinal data, we tested the hypothesis that there would be a congruent disruption in the growth of the anterior corpus callosum, which contains white matter tracts connecting prefrontal cortical regions. METHODS: Areas of five subregions of the corpus callosum were quantified using a semiautomated method from 828 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance scans acquired from 236 children and adolescents with ADHD (429 scans) and 230 typically developing youth (399 scans), most of whom had repeated neuroimaging. Growth rates of each diagnostic group were defined using mixed-model linear regression. RESULTS: Right-handed participants with ADHD showed a significantly higher rate of growth in the anterior-most region of the corpus callosum (estimated annual increase in area of .97{\%}, SEM .12{\%}) than their typically developing peers (annual increase in area of .32{\%} SEM .13{\%}; t = 3.64, p = .0003). No significant diagnostic differences in growth rates were found in any other regions in right-handed participants, and no significant diagnostic differences were found in non-right-handed participants. CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, we found anomalous growth trajectories in the anterior corpus callosum in ADHD. This disrupted anterior callosal growth may reflect, or even drive, the previously reported disruption in the development of prefrontal cortex asymmetry. The finding documents the dynamic, age-dependent nature of callosal and congruent prefrontal cortical abnormalities characterizing ADHD.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A targeted training program for the rehabilitation of communicative abilities-Cognitive Pragmatic Treatment (CPT)-has been developed and previously tested on a sample of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), whose performance was found to have improved. Since cortical plasticity has been recognized as the main mechanism of functional recovery, we investigated whether and how behavioral improvements following the training program are accompanied by brain modifications. Eight TBI patients took part in the training program and were behaviorally assessed pre- and post-treatment; six of these patients were also evaluated with pre- and post-treatment resting state (rs) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). At the end of the rehabilitation program patients showed improvement in overall communicative performance, in both comprehension and production tasks. A follow-up retest revealed the stability of these results 3 months after completing the training program. At the brain level, we found significant increases in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) index in the bilateral precentral gyrus, in the right middle and superior temporal gyri, in the right cingulate gyrus, and in the left inferior parietal lobule. We discuss these differences of brain activity in terms of their possible contribution to promoting recovery.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging-based markers of schizophrenia have been repeatedly shown to separate patients from healthy controls at the single-subject level, but it remains unclear whether these markers reliably distinguish schizophrenia from mood disorders across the life span and generalize to new patients as well as to early stages of these illnesses. The current study used structural MRI-based multivariate pattern classification to (i) identify and cross-validate a differential diagnostic signature separating patients with first-episode and recurrent stages of schizophrenia (n = 158) from patients with major depression (n = 104); and (ii) quantify the impact of major clinical variables, including disease stage, age of disease onset and accelerated brain ageing on the signature's classification performance. This diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging signature was then evaluated in an independent patient cohort from two different centres to test its generalizability to individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 35), first-episode psychosis (n = 23) and clinically defined at-risk mental states for psychosis (n = 89). Neuroanatomical diagnosis was correct in 80{\%} and 72{\%} of patients with major depression and schizophrenia, respectively, and involved a pattern of prefronto-temporo-limbic volume reductions and premotor, somatosensory and subcortical increments in schizophrenia versus major depression. Diagnostic performance was not influenced by the presence of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms in major depression, but earlier disease onset and accelerated brain ageing promoted misclassification in major depression due to an increased neuroanatomical schizophrenia likeness of these patients. Furthermore, disease stage significantly moderated neuroanatomical diagnosis as recurrently-ill patients had higher misclassification rates (major depression: 23{\%}; schizophrenia: 29{\%}) than first-episode patients (major depression: 15{\%}; schizophrenia: 12{\%}). Finally, the trained biomarker assigned 74{\%} of the bipolar patients to the major depression group, while 83{\%} of the first-episode psychosis patients and 77{\%} and 61{\%} of the individuals with an ultra-high risk and low-risk state, respectively, were labelled with schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical information may provide generalizable diagnostic tools distinguishing schizophrenia from mood disorders early in the course of psychosis. Disease course-related variables such as age of disease onset and disease stage as well alterations of structural brain maturation may strongly impact on the neuroanatomical separability of major depression and schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The brain's energy economy excessively favors intrinsic, spontaneous neural activity over extrinsic, evoked activity, presumably to maintain its internal organization. Emerging hypotheses capable of explaining such an investment posit that the brain's intrinsic functional architecture encodes a blueprint for its repertoire of responses to the external world. Yet, there is little evidence directly linking intrinsic and extrinsic activity in the brain. Here we relate differences among individuals in the magnitude of task-evoked activity during performance of an Eriksen flanker task, to spontaneous oscillatory phenomena observed during rest. Specifically, we focused on the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations (LFO, 0.01-0.1Hz) present in the BOLD signal. LFO amplitude measures obtained during rest successfully predicted the magnitude of task-evoked activity in a variety of regions that were all activated during performance of the flanker task. In these regions, higher LFO amplitude at rest predicted higher task-evoked activity. LFO amplitude measures obtained during rest were also found to have robust predictive value for behavior. In midline cingulate regions, LFO amplitudes predicted not only the speed and consistency of performance but also the magnitude of the behavioral congruency effect embedded in the flanker task. These results support the emerging hypothesis that the brain's repertoire of responses to the external world are represented and updated in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder and many of the factors contributing to its pathogenesis are poorly understood. In addition, identifying reliable neurophysiological markers would improve diagnosis and early identification of this disease. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is one major risk factor for schizophrenia. Here, we show further evidence that deviant temporal dynamics of EEG microstates are a potential neurophysiological marker by showing that the resting state patterns of 22q11DS are similar to those found in schizophrenia patients. The EEG microstates are recurrent topographic distributions of the ongoing scalp potential fields with temporal stability of around 80. ms that are mapping the fast reconfiguration of resting state networks. Five minutes of high-density EEG recordings was analysed from 27 adult chronic schizophrenia patients, 27 adult controls, 30 adolescents with 22q11DS, and 28 adolescent controls. In both patient groups we found increased class C, but decreased class D presence and high transition probabilities towards the class C microstates. Moreover, these aberrant temporal dynamics in the two patient groups were also expressed by perturbations of the long-range dependency of the EEG microstates. These findings point to a deficient function of the salience and attention resting state networks in schizophrenia and 22q11DS as class C and class D microstates were previously associated with these networks, respectively. These findings elucidate similarities between individuals at risk and schizophrenia patients and support the notion that abnormal temporal patterns of EEG microstates might constitute a marker for developing schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The resting brain exhibits coherent patterns of spontaneous low-frequency BOLD fluctuations. These so-called resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks are posited to reflect intrinsic representations of functional systems commonly implicated in cognitive function. Yet, the direct relationship between RSFC and the BOLD response induced by task performance remains unclear. Here we examine the relationship between a region's pattern of RSFC across participants and that same region's level of BOLD activation during an Eriksen Flanker task. To achieve this goal we employed a voxel-matched regression method, which assessed whether the magnitude of task-induced activity at each brain voxel could be predicted by measures of RSFC strength for the same voxel, across 26 healthy adults. We examined relationships between task-induced activation and RSFC strength for six different seed regions [Fox, M.D., Snyder, A.Z., Vincent, J.L., Corbetta, M., Van Essen, D.C., Raichle, M.E., 2005. The human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated functional networks. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 9673-9678.], as well as the "default mode" and "task-positive" resting-state networks in their entirety. Our results indicate that, for a number of brain regions, inter-individual differences in task-induced BOLD activity were predicted by one of two resting-state properties: (1) the region's positive connectivity strength with the task-positive network, or (2) its negative connectivity with the default mode network. Strikingly, most of the regions exhibiting a significant relationship between their RSFC properties and task-induced BOLD activity were located in transition zones between the default mode and task-positive networks. These results suggest that a common mechanism governs many brain regions' neural activity during rest and its neural activity during task performance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

High-dimensional pattern classification methods have been reported to have the capacity to determine subtle and spatially complex structural patterns that distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy control subjects using standard magnetic resonance imaging. This study investigates whether such endophenotypic patterns are found in FM via similar image analysis approaches. Methods: A high-dimensional pattern classifier was constructed from a group of 69 patients and 79 control subjects, via an analysis that identified a subtle and spatially complex pattern of reduced brain volumes. The constructed classifier was applied to examine brain structure of 30 FM. Results: The classifier indicated that FM had highly overlapping structural profiles with those of patients. Moreover, an orbitofrontal region of relatively increased white matter was found to contribute significantly to the classification, indicating that white matter alterations, along with reductions of gray matter volumes, might be present in patients and unaffected FM. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that high-dimensional pattern classification can identify complex and subtle structural endophenotypes that are shared by probands and their unaffected FM. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {Many brain disorders and diseases exhibit heterogeneous symptoms and imaging characteristics. This heterogeneity is typically not captured by commonly adopted neuroimaging analyses that seek only a main imaging pattern when two groups need to be differentiated (e.g. patients and controls, or clinical progressors and non-progressors). We propose a novel probabilistic clustering approach, CHIMERA, modeling the pathological process by a combination of multiple regularized transformations from normal/control population to the patient population, thereby seeking to identify multiple imaging patterns that relate to disease effects and to better characterize disease heterogeneity. In our framework, normal and patient populations are considered as point distributions that are matched by a variant of the coherent point drift algorithm. We explain how the posterior probabilities produced during the MAP optimization of CHIMERA can be used for clustering the patients into groups and identifying disease subtypes. CHIMERA was first validated on a synthetic dataset and then on a clinical dataset mixing 317 control subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkison's Disease (PD). CHIMERA produced better clustering results compared to two standard clustering approaches. We further analyzed 390 T1 MRI scans from Alzheimer's patients. We discovered two main and reproducible AD subtypes displaying significant differences in cognitive performance.},

abstract = {Gaussian smoothing of images prior to applying voxel-based statistics is an important step in voxel-based analysis and statistical parametric mapping (VBA-SPM) and is used to account for registration errors, to Gaussianize the data and to integrate imaging signals from a region around each voxel. However, it has also become a limitation of VBA-SPM based methods, since it is often chosen empirically and lacks spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of the region of interest, such as a region of atrophy or functional activity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, named optimally-discriminative voxel-based analysis (ODVBA), for determining the optimal spatially adaptive smoothing of images, followed by applying voxel-based group analysis. In ODVBA, nonnegative discriminative projection is applied regionally to get the direction that best discriminates between two groups, e.g., patients and controls; this direction is equivalent to local filtering by an optimal kernel whose coefficients define the optimally discriminative direction. By considering all the neighborhoods that contain a given voxel, we then compose this information to produce the statistic for each voxel. Finally, permutation tests are used to obtain a statistical parametric map of group differences. ODVBA has been evaluated using simulated data in which the ground truth is known and with data from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study. The experimental results have shown that the proposed ODVBA can precisely describe the shape and location of structural abnormality.},

Nevertheless, we lack an integrated view of the brain mechanisms underlying such lapses. By investigating trial-by-trial relationships between brain activity and response time in humans, we determined that attentional lapses begin with reduced prestimulus activity in anterior cingulate and right prefrontal regions involved in controlling attention. Less efficient stimulus processing during attentional lapses was also characterized by less deactivation of a 'default-mode' network, reduced stimulus-evoked sensory activity, and increased activity in widespread regions of frontal and parietal cortex. Finally, consistent with a mechanism for recovering from attentional lapses, increased stimulus-evoked activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and the right temporal-parietal junction predicted better performance on the next trial. Our findings provide a new, system-wide understanding of the patterns of brain activity that are associated with brief attentional lapses, which informs both theoretical and clinical models of goal-directed behavior.},

abstract = {Repeated measurements and multimodal data are common in neuroimaging research. Despite this, conventional approaches to group level analysis ignore these repeated measurements in favour of multiple between-subject models using contrasts of interest. This approach has a number of drawbacks as certain designs and comparisons of interest are either not possible or complex to implement. Unfortunately, even when attempting to analyse group level data within a repeated-measures framework, the methods implemented in popular software packages make potentially unrealistic assumptions about the covariance structure across the brain. In this paper, we describe how this issue can be addressed in a simple and efficient manner using the multivariate form of the familiar general linear model (GLM), as implemented in a new MATLAB toolbox. This multivariate framework is discussed, paying particular attention to methods of inference by permutation. Comparisons with existing approaches and software packages for dependent group-level neuroimaging data are made. We also demonstrate how this method is easily adapted for dependency at the group level when multiple modalities of imaging are collected from the same individuals. Follow-up of these multimodal models using linear discriminant functions (LDA) is also discussed, with applications to future studies wishing to integrate multiple scanning techniques into investigating populations of interest.},

The rate at which information is emitted from different nodes in the network and how this output process changes under different external conditions are general questions that are not unique to neuroscience, but are of interest in multiple classes of telecommunication networks. In the present study we show how some of these questions may be addressed using tools from telecommunications research. An important system statistic for modeling and performance evaluation of distributed communication systems is the time between successive departures of units of information at each node in the network. We describe a method to extract and fully characterize the distribution of such inter-departure times from the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). We show that inter-departure times are well fitted by the two-parameter Gamma distribution. Moreover, they are not spatially or neurophysiologically trivial and instead are regionally specific and sensitive to the presence of sensory input. In both the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, inter-departure time distributions were more dispersed over posterior parietal channels, close to regions which are known to have the most dense structural connectivity. The biggest differences between the two conditions were observed at occipital sites, where inter-departure times were significantly more variable in the eyes-open condition. Together, these results suggest that message departure times are indicative of network traffic and capture a novel facet of neural activity.},

abstract = {A number of studies have characterized the changes in variability of brain signals with brain maturation from the perspective of considering the human brain as a complex system. Specifically, it has been shown that complexity of brain signals increases in development. On one hand, such an increase in complexity can be attributed to more specialized and differentiated brain regions able to express a higher repertoire of mental microstates. On the other hand, it can be explained by increased integration between widely distributed neuronal populations and establishment of new connections. The goal of this study was to see which of these two mechanisms is dominant, accounting for the previously observed increase in signal complexity. Using information-theoretic tools based on scalp-recorded EEG measurements, we examined the trade-off between local and distributed variability of brain signals in infants and children separated into age groups of 1-2, 2-8, 9-24, and 24-66 months old. We found that developmental changes were characterized by a decrease in the amount of information processed locally, with a peak in alpha frequency range. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the variability of brain signals processed as a distributed network. Complementary analysis of phase locking revealed an age-related pattern of increased synchronization in the lower part of the spectrum, up to the alpha rhythms. At the same time, we observed the desynchronization effects associated with brain development in the higher beta to lower gamma range.},

abstract = {Objective: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common known genetic risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. The authors conducted a longitudinal evaluation of adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to identify early risk factors for the development of psychotic disorders. Method: Sixty children, 31 with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 29 comparison subjects with idiopathic developmental disability matched for age and IQ, underwent a baseline evaluation between 1998 and 2000; of these, 51 children (28 and 23 in the two groups, respectively) underwent follow-up evaluation between 2003 and 2005. A standardized comprehensive psychiatric, psychological, and adaptive functioning evaluation was conducted in both waves. Participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were also genotyped for the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) Met/Val polymorphism and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: The two groups had similar baseline neuropsychiatric profiles. At follow-up, 32.1{\%} of subjects with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome had developed psychotic disorders as compared with 4.3{\%} of comparison subjects. In the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome group, baseline subthreshold psychotic symptoms interacted both with the COMT genotype and with baseline symptoms of anxiety or depression to predict 61{\%} of the variance in severity of psychosis at follow-up evaluation. Lower baseline verbal IQ was also associated with more severe psychotic symptoms at follow-up evaluation. Conclusions: Genetic, cognitive, and psychiatric risk factors for the evolution of psychotic disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome during adolescence were identified. Early intervention in the subgroup of children with subthreshold signs of psychosis and internalizing symptoms (especially anxiety symptoms) may reduce the risk of developing psychotic disorders during adolescence.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that brain networks derived from neuroimaging data have nontrivial topological features, such as small-world organization, modular structure and highly connected hubs. In these studies, the extent of connectivity between pairs of brain regions has often been measured using some form of statistical correlation. This article demonstrates that correlation as a measure of connectivity in and of itself gives rise to networks with non-random topological features. In particular, networks in which connectivity is measured using correlation are inherently more clustered than random networks, and as such are more likely to be small-world networks. Partial correlation as a measure of connectivity also gives rise to networks with non-random topological features. Partial correlation networks are inherently less clustered than random networks. Network measures in correlation networks should be benchmarked against null networks that respect the topological structure induced by correlation measurements. Prevalently used random rewiring algorithms do not yield appropriate null networks for some network measures. Null networks are proposed to explicitly normalize for the inherent topological structure found in correlation networks, resulting in more conservative estimates of small-world organization. A number of steps may be needed to normalize each network measure individually and control for distinct features (e.g. degree distribution). The main conclusion of this article is that correlation can and should be used to measure connectivity, however appropriate null networks should be used to benchmark network measures in correlation networks. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

This purported network—medial prefrontal, medial-temporal, and medial and lateral parietal regions—is similar to that observed during default-mode processing and has been argued to represent self-projection [Buckner, R.

To date, no systematic and quantitative demonstration of evidence for this common network has been presented. Using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, we conducted four separate quantitative meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies on: (a) autobiographical memory, (b) navigation, (c) theory of mind, and (d) default mode. A conjunction analysis between these domains demonstrated a high degree of correspondence. We compared these findings to a separate ALE analysis of prospection studies and found additional correspondence. Across all domains, and consistent with the proposed network, correspondence was found within the medial-temporal lobe, precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, and the temporo-parietal junction. Additionally, this study revealed that the core network extends to lateral prefrontal and occipital cortices. Autobiographical memory, prospection, theory of mind, and default mode demonstrated further reliable involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortices. Autobiographical memory and theory of mind, previously studied as distinct, exhibited extensive functional overlap. These findings represent quantitative evidence for a core network underlying a variety of cognitive domains.},

While several studies performed on patients with 22q11DS showed the presence of abnormal functional connectivity in this syndrome, how these alterations affect large-scale network organization is still unknown. Here we performed a network modularity analysis on whole-brain functional connectomes derived from the resting-state fMRI of 40 patients with 22q11DS and 41 healthy control participants, aged between 9 and 30 years old. We then split the sample at 18 years old to obtain two age subgroups and repeated the modularity analyses. We found alterations of modular communities affecting the visuo-spatial network and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in both age groups. These results corroborate previous structural and functional studies in 22q11DS that showed early impairment of visuo-spatial processing regions. Furthermore, as ACC has been linked to the development of psychotic symptoms in 22q11DS, the early impairment of its functional connectivity provide further support that ACC alterations may provide potential biomarkers for an increased risk of schizophrenia. Finally, we found an abnormal modularity partition of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex only in adults with 22q11DS, suggesting the presence of an abnormal development of functional network communities during adolescence in 22q11DS.},

The longitudinal analysis used 40-month follow-up data to evaluate differences in progression of volume loss between intensive and standard glycemic treatment arms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Participants with longer diabetes duration had significantly lower gray matter volumes, primarily in certain regions in the frontal and temporal lobes. The longitudinal analysis of treatment effects revealed a heterogeneous pattern of decelerated loss of gray matter volume associated with intensive glycemic treatment. Intensive treatment decelerated volume loss, particularly in regions adjacent to those cross-sectionally associated with diabetes duration. No significant relationship between low versus high baseline HbA1c levels and brain changes was found. Finally, regions in which cognitive change was associated with longitudinal volume loss had only small overlap with regions related to diabetes duration and to treatment effects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Applying advanced quantitative image pattern analysis methods on longitudinal MRI data of a large sample of patients with type 2 diabetes, we demonstrate that there are spatially specific patterns of brain changes that vary by diabetes characteristics and that the progression of gray matter volume loss is slowed by intensive glycemic treatment, particularly in regions adjacent to areas affected by diabetes.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional MRI is a powerful technique for mapping the functional organization of the human brain. However, for many types of connectivity analysis, high-resolution voxelwise analyses are computationally infeasible and dimensionality reduction is typically used to limit the number of network nodes. Most commonly, network nodes are defined using standard anatomic atlases that do not align well with functional neuroanatomy or regions of interest covering a small portion of the cortex. Data-driven parcellation methods seek to overcome such limitations, but existing approaches are highly dependent on initialization procedures and produce spatially fragmented parcels or overly isotropic parcels that are unlikely to be biologically grounded. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based parcellation method that relies on a discrete Markov Random Field framework. The spatial connectedness of the parcels is explicitly enforced by shape priors. The shape of the parcels is adapted to underlying data through the use of functional geodesic distances. Our method is initialization-free and rapidly segments the cortex in a single optimization. The performance of the method was assessed using a large developmental cohort of more than 850 subjects. Compared to two prevalent parcellation methods, our approach provides superior reproducibility for a similar data fit. Furthermore, compared to other methods, it avoids incoherent parcels. Finally, the method's utility is demonstrated through its ability to detect strong brain developmental effects that are only weakly observed using other methods.},

abstract = {A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.},

abstract = {Background: Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), the most common microdeletion in humans, is associated with multiple medical features, almost universal cognitive deficits, and a high risk of schizophrenia. The metabolic basis of the psychological/psychiatric features is not well understood. Volumetric brain imaging studies have shown that gray matter abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an area that is believed to be integral for higher neurocognition, as well as being involved in schizophrenia, are associated with the psychological manifestations. However, studies have not characterized any possible metabolite alterations within the DLPFC of children with 22q11DS and their correlations with the psychological findings. Methods: We conducted a short echo time, single-voxel, in vivo proton spectroscopy study involving children with 22q11DS (n = 26) and matched control subjects (n = 23). Results: Absolute N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels from the DLPFC were significantly elevated in children with 22q11DS compared with control subjects and the elevations were associated with poor global functioning and higher rates of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Children with 22q11DS had a lack of an age-associated decrease in NAA levels, a trend seen in the control subjects. However, the results did not remain statistically significant after corrections for multiple comparisons were made. Conclusions: These findings represent the first report of proton spectroscopy in children with 22q11DS. The elevated DLPFC NAA levels and the lack of decreasing trends in NAA with age in the 22q11DS group relative to control subjects suggest an alteration in cortical development. Also, such neuronal dysmaturation is associated with psychopathology in children with 22q11DS. ?? 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Velocardiofacial syndrome is a common genetic condition often accompanied by mild cognitive impairment. Children and adolescents with velocardiofacial syndrome also are at greater risk for developing serious neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood, particularly schizophrenia-like disorders. The purpose of this preliminary study was to 1) elucidate through brain imaging the neurobiological basis of cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems in velocardiofacial syndrome, and 2) consider the association between variations in neuroanatomy in velocardiofacial syndrome subjects and the associated neurobehavioral phenotype. METHOD: Fifteen children and adolescents with velocardiofacial syndrome were matched by age and gender with 15 comparison subjects. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed to provide quantitative measures of specified brain tissues and regions. Rater-blind morphometric analyses were conducted to examine tissue volumes of the four lobes and the cerebellum. RESULTS: Total brain volume was approximately 11{\%} smaller in the children with velocardiofacial syndrome. Gray matter volume was reduced to a lesser extent (7.5{\%}) than white matter volume (16.3{\%}). Multivariate analyses of variance indicated a distinct pattern of regional morphological variation among the children with velocardiofacial syndrome. Specifically, frontal lobe tissue tended to be enlarged relative to the overall reduction in brain volume. Normal symmetry of parietal lobe tissue observed in the comparison group was not evident in the velocardiofacial syndrome group. This loss of symmetry was attributable to a significant reduction of gray matter in the left parietal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant brain morphology is associated with velocardiofacial syndrome. These changes are potentially related to the language and learning deficits associated with the syndrome and may provide clues about neurodevelopmental pathways associated with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Cognitive control is a process that unfolds over time and regulates thought and action in the service of achieving goals and managing unanticipated challenges. Prevailing accounts attribute the protracted development of this mental process to incremental changes in the functional organization of a cognitive control network. Here, we challenge the notion that cognitive control is linked to a topologically static network, and argue that the capacity to manage unanticipated challenges and its development should instead be characterized in terms of inter-regional functional coupling dynamics. Ongoing changes in temporal coupling have long represented a fundamental pillar in both empirical and theoretical-based accounts of brain function, but have been largely ignored by traditional neuroimaging methods that assume a fixed functional architecture. There is, however, a growing recognition of the importance of temporal coupling dynamics for brain function, and this has led to rapid innovations in analytic methods. Results in this new frontier of neuroimaging suggest that time-varying changes in connectivity strength and direction exist at the large scale and further, that network patterns, like cognitive control process themselves, are transient and dynamic.},

abstract = {The transition from childhood to adulthood is marked by pronounced functional and structural brain transformations that impact cognition and behavior. Here, we use a functional imaging approach to reveal dynamic changes in coupling strength between networks and the expression of discrete brain configurations over human development during rest and a cognitive control task. Although the brain's repertoire of functional states was generally preserved across ages, state-specific temporal features, such as the frequency of expression and the amount of time spent in select states, varied by age in ways that were dependent on condition. Increasing age was associated with greater variability of connection strengths across time at rest, while there was a selective inversion of this effect in higher-order networks during implementation of cognitive control. The results suggest that development is characterized by the modi-fication of dynamic coupling to both maximize and constrain functional variability in response to ongoing cognitive and behavioral requirements.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) has become an increasingly utilized approach for analyzing brain imaging data. In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

Recently, a new site has exploded into prominence: Pinterest became the fastest social network to reach 10M users, growing 4000{\%} in 2011 alone. While many Pinterest articles have appeared in the popular press, there has been little scholarly work so far. In this paper, we use a quantitative approach to study three research questions about the site. What drives activity on Pinterest? What role does gender play in the site's social connections? And finally, what distinguishes Pinterest from existing networks, in particular Twitter? In short, we find that being female means more repins, but fewer followers, and that four verbs set Pinterest apart from Twitter: use, look, want and need. This work serves as an early snapshot of Pinterest that later work can leverage.},

Processing social mediamessages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings.We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.},

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], al- though the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were re- duced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and non- verbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The socio-cultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of "screen captures" for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.},

abstract = {The mature brain is organized into distinct neural networks defined by regions demonstrating correlated activity during task performance as well as rest. While research has begun to examine differences in these networks between children and adults, little is known about developmental changes during early adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Central Executive Network (CEN) at ages 10 and 13 in a longitudinal sample of 45 participants. In the DMN, participants showed increasing integration (i.e., stronger within-network correlations) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex. During this time frame participants also showed increased segregation (i.e., weaker between-network correlations) between the PCC and the CEN. Similarly, from age 10 to 13, participants showed increased connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other CEN nodes, as well as increasing DMN segregation. IQ was significantly positively related to CEN integration at age 10, and between-network segregation at both ages. These findings highlight early adolescence as a period of significant maturation for the brain's functional architecture and demonstrate the utility of longitudinal designs to investigate neural network development.},

abstract = {Functional connectomics is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of neuroimaging research. Yet, concerns remain regarding the use of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) to characterize inter-individual variation in the functional connectome. In particular, recent findings that "micro" head movements can introduce artifactual inter-individual and group-related differences in R-fMRI metrics have raised concerns. Here, we first build on prior demonstrations of regional variation in the magnitude of framewise displacements associated with a given head movement, by providing a comprehensive voxel-based examination of the impact of motion on the BOLD signal (i.e., motion-BOLD relationships). Positive motion-BOLD relationships were detected in primary and supplementary motor areas, particularly in low motion datasets. Negative motion-BOLD relationships were most prominent in prefrontal regions, and expanded throughout the brain in high motion datasets (e.g., children). Scrubbing of volumes with FD. {\textgreater}0.2 effectively removed negative but not positive correlations; these findings suggest that positive relationships may reflect neural origins of motion while negative relationships are likely to originate from motion artifact. We also examined the ability of motion correction strategies to eliminate artifactual differences related to motion among individuals and between groups for a broad array of voxel-wise R-fMRI metrics. Residual relationships between motion and the examined R-fMRI metrics remained for all correction approaches, underscoring the need to covary motion effects at the group-level. Notably, global signal regression reduced relationships between motion and inter-individual differences in correlation-based R-fMRI metrics; Z-standardization (mean-centering and variance normalization) of subject-level maps for R-fMRI metrics prior to group-level analyses demonstrated similar advantages. Finally, our test-retest (TRT) analyses revealed significant motion effects on TRT reliability for R-fMRI metrics. Generally, motion compromised reliability of R-fMRI metrics, with the exception of those based on frequency characteristics - particularly, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). The implications of our findings for decision-making regarding the assessment and correction of motion are discussed, as are insights into potential differences among volume-based metrics of motion. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is likely to be caused by several susceptibility genes and may have environmental factors that interact with susceptibility genes and/or nongenetic causes. Recent evidence supports the likelihood that 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22qDS) represents an identifiable genetic subtype of schizophrenia. 22qDS is an under-recognized genetic syndrome associated with microdeletions on chromosome 22 and a variable expression that often includes mild congenital dysmorphic features, hypernasal speech, and learning difficulties. Initial evidence indicates that a minority of patients with schizophrenia ({\~{}}2{\%}) may have 22qDS and that prevalence may be somewhat higher in subpopulations with developmental delay. This paper proposes clinical criteria (including facial features, learning disabilities, hypernasal speech, congenital heart defects and other congenital anomalies) to aid in identifying patients with schizophrenia who may have this subtype and outlines features that may increase the index of suspicion for this syndrome. Although no specific causal gene or genes have yet been identified in the deletion region, 22qDS may represent a more homogeneous subtype of schizophrenia. This subtype may serve as a model for neurodevelopmental origins of schizophrenia that could aid in delineating etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms.

@article{Ethofer2009,
abstract = {The ability to correctly interpret emotional signals from others is crucial for successful social interaction. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that voice-sensitive auditory areas [1-3] activate to a broad spectrum of vocally expressed emotions more than to neutral speech melody (prosody). However, this enhanced response occurs irrespective of the specific emotion category, making it impossible to distinguish different vocal emotions with conventional analyses [4-8]. Here, we presented pseudowords spoken in five prosodic categories (anger, sadness, neutral, relief, joy) during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), then employed multivariate pattern analysis [9, 10] to discriminate between these categories on the basis of the spatial response pattern within the auditory cortex. Our results demonstrate successful decoding of vocal emotions from fMRI responses in bilateral voice-sensitive areas, which??could not be obtained by using averaged response amplitudes only. Pairwise comparisons showed that each category could be classified against all other alternatives, indicating for each emotion a specific spatial signature that generalized across speakers. These results demonstrate for the first time that emotional information is represented by distinct spatial patterns that can be decoded from brain activity in modality-specific cortical areas. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Allen2014,
abstract = {Spontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity (FC) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording. In this work, we describe an approach to assess whole-brain FC dynamics based on spatial independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering of windowed correlation matrices. The method is applied to resting-state data from a large sample (n = 405) of young adults. Our analysis of FC variability highlights particularly flexible connections between regions in lateral parietal and cingulate cortex, and argues against a labeling scheme where such regions are treated as separate and antagonistic entities. Additionally, clustering analysis reveals unanticipated FC states that in part diverge strongly from stationary connectivity patterns and challenge current descriptions of interactions between large-scale networks. Temporal trends in the occurrence of different FC states motivate theories regarding their functional roles and relationships with vigilance/arousal. Overall, we suggest that the study of time-varying aspects of FC can unveil flexibility in the functional coordination between different neural systems, and that the exploitation of these dynamics in further investigations may improve our understanding of behavioral shifts and adaptive processes.},

abstract = {We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of intrinsic brain activity in 23 patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 27 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Two different frequency bands were analyzed (slow-5:0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4:0.027-0.073 Hz). In many brain regions, widespread ALFF differences between the two frequency bands were observed, including predominantly the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (Hip/PHG), insula, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Compared to controls, AD patients showed decreased ALFF values in the bilateral PCC/PCu, inferior parietal lobe, and several temporal regions, and increased ALFF values mainly in the bilateral Hip/PHG, and middle and inferior temporal gyri. Intriguingly, the ALFF abnormalities in the left PCu, left supramarginal gyrus, and several temporal regions were greater in the slow-5 band compared to the slow-4 band. Moreover, correcting for gray matter volume loss significantly affected the functional analytical results, suggesting that gray matter loss can partially account for the functional imaging analytical results obtained in AD. Finally, we showed that regions with changes in ALFF demonstrated a significant correlation with patient cognitive performance as measured using Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The results also demonstrated a significant correlation between hippocampal volume and the ALFF in slow-5 band in the AD group. This study demonstrated widespread ALFF abnormalities of intrinsic brain activity in AD and revealed that the ALFF abnormalities in severe specific regions were frequency-dependent. Taken together, our findings provided novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of AD and may be helpful in the development of imaging biomarkers for disease diagnosis.},

abstract = {Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural activity. The objective of this study was to explore brain functional changes in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by measuring the amplitude of the BOLD signals. Eighteen amnestic MCI patients and 20 healthy elderly individuals underwent the fMRI scan. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. MCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, left lateral temporal cortex and right ventral medial prefrontal cortex and increased ALFF in the left temporal-parietal joint (TPJ) and inferior parietal lobule. The ALFF value in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex was positively correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Exam. Reduced medial temporal lobe activity may implicate the underlying memory impairment mechanisms in MCI. Increased TPJ and inferior parietal lobule activity may indicate the compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. These findings suggest that ALFF analysis could provide a useful tool in the fMRI study of MCI.},

abstract = {Here we utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in 24 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Two different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz) were analyzed. We showed that there were widespread differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two bands in many brain regions, predominantly including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), basal ganglia, and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Compared to controls, the aMCI patients had decreased ALFF/fALFF values in the PCC/PCu, MPFC, hippocampus/PHG, basal ganglia, and prefrontal regions, and increased ALFF/fALFF values mainly in several occipital and temporal regions. Specifically, we observed that the ALFF/fALFF abnormalities in the PCC/PCu, PHG, and several occipital regions were greater in the slow-5 band than in the slow-4 band. Finally, our results of functional analysis were not significantly influenced by the gray matter loss in the MCI patients, suggesting that the results reflect functional differences between groups. Together, our data suggest that aMCI patients have widespread abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity, and the abnormalities depend on the studied frequency bands of R-fMRI data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables investigation of the intrinsic functional organization of the brain. Fractal parameters such as the Hurst exponent, H, describe the complexity of endogenous low-frequency fMRI time series on a continuum from random (H = .5) to ordered (H = 1). Shifts in fractal scaling of physiological time series have been associated with neurological and cardiac conditions. Methods Resting-state fMRI time series were recorded in 30 male adults with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) and 33 age- and IQ-matched male volunteers. The Hurst exponent was estimated in the wavelet domain and between-group differences were investigated at global and voxel level and in regions known to be involved in autism. Results Complex fractal scaling of fMRI time series was found in both groups but globally there was a significant shift to randomness in the ASC (mean H = .758, SD = .045) compared with neurotypical volunteers (mean H = .788, SD = .047). Between-group differences in H, which was always reduced in the ASC group, were seen in most regions previously reported to be involved in autism, including cortical midline structures, medial temporal structures, lateral temporal and parietal structures, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Severity of autistic symptoms was negatively correlated with H in retrosplenial and right anterior insular cortex. Conclusions Autism is associated with a small but significant shift to randomness of endogenous brain oscillations. Complexity measures may provide physiological indicators for autism as they have done for other medical conditions. ?? 2010 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {The emerging organization of anatomical and functional connections during human brain development is thought to facilitate global integration of information. Recent empirical and computational studies have shown that this enhanced capacity for information processing enables a diversified dynamic repertoire that manifests in neural activity as irregularity and noise. However, transient functional networks unfold over multiple time, scales and the embedding of a particular region depends not only on development, but also on the manner in which sensory and cognitive systems are engaged. Here we show that noise is a facet of neural activity that is also sensitive to the task context and is highly region specific. Children (6-16 yr) and adults (20-41 yr) performed a one-back face recognition task with inverted and upright faces. Neuromagnetic activity was estimated at several hundred sources in the brain by applying a beamforming technique to the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). During development, neural activity became more variable across the whole brain, with most robust increases in medial parietal regions, such as the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. For young children and adults, activity evoked by upright faces was more variable and noisy compared with inverted faces, and this effect was reliable only in the right fusiform gyrus. These results are consistent with the notion that upright faces engender a variety of integrative neural computations, such as the relations among facial features and their holistic constitution. This study shows that transient changes in functional integration modulated by task demand are evident in the variability of regional neural activity.},

@article{Swillen1997,
abstract = {Introduction The velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is a multiple congenital malformation syndrome caused by a submicroscopic deletion in chromosome 22q11. In most patients the deletion occurs de novo, but autosomal inheritance with variable expression is observed. Its major features are a cleft palate or velopharyngeal insufficiency, cardiac anomalies, typical facial appearance, learning disabilities and/or mental retardation. We report data on a group of 37 VCFS patients with particular attention to their intelligence, behaviour and social competence. Results Intelligence Learning difficulties (defined as FSIQ {\textless} 70 or {\textgreater}2 S.D. below the mean) were found in 45{\%}. In the majority of them, the learning difficulties were mild (38{\%}) and only 2 patients had moderate learning difficulties. Severe learning difficulties seem to be rare in VCFS. Only one child with a familial deletion and cerebellar hypoplasia was severely retarded. In the present study, 8 patients were initially referred for diagnosis because of developmental delay. This could have introduced a bias in the study. However, we found no difference in FSIQ between this group of patients and the remaining patients. Our findings are therefore representative for VCFS, irrespective of their referral pattern. Also, in this series, 37 consecutively diagnosed patients were examined, thus eliminating a further possible bias. We found also a wide variability in intelligence in VCFS patients. Until now there were no good explanations for this variability in intelligence (e.g. no correlation with the extent of the deletion). Also we found no correlation between intelligence and the presence or absence of a congenital heart defect. However, the incidence of learning difficulties was found to be much higher in the patients with a familial deletion versus patients with a de novo deletion. We found a statistically (Student T-test and IQ {\textgreater} 30) significant difference of 16.6 IQ-points between the mean FSIQ of the patients with a «familial» deletion (mean FSIQ 63.2) and the mean FSIQ of the patients with a «de novo» deletion (mean FSIQ 79.8). As far as we know, this has not been reported in VCFS. This difference, however, can possibly be explained in part by lower educational level of affected parents versus unaffected parents. Indeed, parental IQ and socioeconomic status is a major determining factor of the IQ in their children, and this was here estimated by their educational level. The parent in familial cases, not carrying the deletion, had a lower SES compared to parents of de novo cases, suggesting assortative mating. Associated cerebral malformations could also be a possible explanation: in the present study the boy with severe learning difficulties showed a cerebral malformation, although other researchers did not find such a correlation. Besides the distribution of intelligence, the present study also revealed data on the intelligence profile of these children. Analysis of the Weschler subscales showed a statistically significant difference between the average Verbal IQ and average Performance IQ. Subtest analysis was not done because of the small number if children tested by the WISC-R (n = 11). In most children however, specific cognitive deficits (i.e. visuo-perceptual-spatial ability and planning ability) could be suspected from the profile of the WISC-R. These results indicate that children with VCFS possibly might have a higher risk for developing problems in the field of visuoperceptual-spatial abilities and of executive functioning. This needs further investigation in a larger patient group, however. Behaviour In the toddler group (children between 2-3 years; n = 6), somatic complaints («constipation», and «eats poor») and (social) withdrawal were reported in 5 of the 6 children on the CBCL. Only one child had a total T-score within the clinical range (T {\textgreater} 63). For the older children and adolescents (n = 19) highest scores were found on «Social Problems» (average T-score of 64), «Attention problems» (average T-score of 64) and «Withdrawn» (average T-score of 58). Post hoc statistical testing (Scheffe's test) shows that the clusters «Social Problems» and «Attention Problems» score statistically significantly higher than the other clusters of problem behaviour, except the cluster «Withdrawn». In addition to social and attention problems, our data also point to higher scores on the anxious/depression syndrome in the older children (11 years and older). Adolescent and adult patients with VCFS are at risk for developing psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The most common symptoms described in these reports are those associated with depression and anxiety disorders and include disturbed mood, severe vegetative symptoms, disturbed appetite, fatigue, and low self-esteem, as well as poor concentration and decision-making ability. Therefore, the finding in this study of higher levels on the depression/anxious syndrome in the older group is of interest, since this could be a first sign of developing psychopathology. Further prospective studies are needed to address this question. A multidisciplinary clinic will be organised in the near future, to deal with the different aspects (cardiac, genetic, paediatric, speech, social, cognitive, educational and psychiatric) of this disorder.},

The syndrome is associated with general cognitive impairments and specific deficits in visual-spatial ability, non-verbal reasoning, and planning skills. 22q11DS is also associated with behavioral and psychiatric abnormalities, including a markedly elevated risk for schizophrenia. Research findings indicate that people with schizophrenia, as well as those identified as schizoptypic, show specific cognitive deficits in the areas of sustained attention, executive functioning, and verbal working memory. The present study examined such schizophrenic-like cognitive deficits in children and adolescents with 22q11DS (n = 26) and controls (n = 25) using a cross-sectional design. As hypothesized, 22q11DS participants exhibited deficits in intelligence, achievement, sustained attention, executive functioning, and verbal working memory compared to controls. Furthermore, deficits in attention and executive functioning were more pronounced in the 22q11DS sample relative to general cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that the same pattern of neuropsychological impairment seen in patients with schizophrenia is present in non-psychotic children identified as at-risk for the development of schizophrenia based on a known genetic risk marker. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Stronger reading decoding and spelling skills as well as auditory/verbal rote memory skills have been reported to be areas of relative strength. Conversely, significant visuospatial dysfunction, diminished math attainment, and executive dysfunction have all been reported as phenotypic.

The authors report what is to their knowledge the first large-scale collaborative study of rates and sex distributions of psychiatric disorders from childhood to adulthood in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The associations among psychopathology, intellect, and functioning were examined in a subgroup of participants. METHOD The 1,402 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ages 6-68 years, were assessed for psychiatric disorders with validated diagnostic instruments. Data on intelligence and adaptive functioning were available for 183 participants ages 6 to 24 years. RESULTS Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most frequent disorder in children (37.10{\%}) and was overrepresented in males. Anxiety disorders were more prevalent than mood disorders at all ages, but especially in children and adolescents. Anxiety and unipolar mood disorders were overrepresented in females. Psychotic disorders were present in 41{\%} of adults over age 25. Males did not predominate in psychotic or autism spectrum disorders. Hierarchical regressions in the subgroup revealed that daily living skills were predicted by the presence of anxiety disorders. Psychopathology was not associated with communication or socialization skills. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study of psychiatric morbidity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It validates previous findings that this condition is one of the strongest risk factors for psychosis. Anxiety and developmental disorders were also prevalent. These results highlight the need to monitor and reduce the long-term burden of psychopathology in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.},

abstract = {Background: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is regarded as an etiologically homogenous model for understanding neuroanatomic disruptions associated with a high risk for schizophrenia. This study utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze white matter microstructure in individuals with 22q11.2DS. We focused on the cingulum bundle (CB), previously shown to be disrupted in patients with schizophrenia and associated with symptoms of psychosis. Methods: White matter microstructure was assessed in the anterior, superior, and posterior CB using the tractography algorithm in DTIStudio. Neuropsychological function, presence of prodromal symptoms of psychosis, and medication history were assessed in all participants. Results: Relative to controls, young adults with 22q11.2DS showed alterations in most DTI metrics of the CB. Alterations were associated with positive prodromal symptoms of psychosis. However, when individuals with 22q11.2DS were divided by usage of antipsychotics/mood stabilizers, the medicated and non-medicated groups differed significantly in axial diffusivity of the anterior CB and in fractional anisotropy of the superior CB. DTI metrics did not differ between the medicated group and the control group. Conclusions: Results suggest that the microstructure of the CB is altered in individuals with 22q11.2DS, and that those alterations may underlie positive prodromal symptoms of psychosis. Our findings further provide preliminary evidence that antipsychotic/mood stabilizer usage may have a reparative effect on white matter microstructure in prodromal 22q11.2DS, independent of the potential effects of psychosis. Future studies of white matter pathology in individuals with 22q11.2DS should test for potential effects of medication on white matter microstructure.},

abstract = {In order to investigate electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers of auditory processing for schizophrenia, we studied a group with a well known high-risk profile: patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11 DS) have a 30{\%} risk of developing schizophrenia during adulthood. We performed high-density EEG source imaging to measure auditory gating of the P50 component of the evoked potential and middle to late latency auditory processing in 21 participants with the 22q11.2 deletion and 17 age-matched healthy controls. While we found no indication of altered P50 suppression in 22q11 DS, we observed marked differences for the first N1 component with increased amplitudes on central electrodes, corresponding to increased activations in dorsal anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex. We also found a left lateralized reduction of activation of primary and secondary auditory cortex during the second N1 (120 ms) and the P2 component in 22q11 DS. Our results show that sensory gating and activations until 50. ms were preserved in 22q11 DS, while impairments appear at latencies that correspond to higher order auditory processing. While the increased activation of cingulate and medial frontal cortex could reflect developmental changes in 22q11 DS, the reduced activity seen in left auditory cortex might serve as a biomarker for the development of schizophrenia, if confirmed by longitudinal research protocols. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Previous studies have repeatedly found altered temporal characteristics of EEG microstates in schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adolescents affected by the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), known to have a 30 fold increased risk to develop schizophrenia, already show deviant EEG microstates. If this is the case, temporal alterations of EEG microstates in 22q11DS individuals could be considered as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. We used high-density (204 channel) EEG to explore between-group microstate differences in 30 adolescents with 22q11DS and 28 age-matched controls. We found an increased presence of one microstate class (class C) in the 22q11DS adolescents with respect to controls that was associated with positive prodromal symptoms (hallucinations). A previous across-age study showed that the class C microstate was more present during adolescence and a combined EEG-fMRI study associated the class C microstate with the salience resting state network, a network known to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Therefore, the increased class C microstates could be indexing the increased risk of 22q11DS individuals to develop schizophrenia if confirmed by our ongoing longitudinal study comparing both the adult 22q11DS individuals with and without schizophrenia, as well as schizophrenic individuals with and without 22q11DS. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The problem of the self has been of increasing interest in recent neuroscience. Brain imaging studies have raised the question of whether neural activity in cortical midline regions is self-specific and whether self-specific activity is related to resting state activity (RSA). A quantitative meta-analysis that included 87 studies, representing 1433 participants, was conducted to discuss these questions. First, the specificity of the self (e.g. hearing one's own name, seeing one's own face) was tested and compared across familiar (using stimuli from personally known people) and other (non-self-non-familiar, i.e. strangers and widely-known figures) conditions. Second, the relationship between the self and resting state activity, as reflected by the default-mode network (DMN), was tested. The results indicated that the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) is specifically involved in self-processing when compared to familiarity, other, and task/stimulus effects. On the contrary, other midline regions, i.e., medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were functionally unspecific as they were recruited during the processing of both self-specific and familiar stimuli. Finally, the PACC was recruited during self-specific stimuli and this activity overlapped with DMN activity during resting state, thus distinguishing the self-related processing from both that of the familiar and other conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that our sense of self may result from a specific kind of interaction between resting state activity and stimulus-induced activity, i.e., rest-stimulus interaction, within the midline regions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Given rapid developments in both hardware and analysis tools, the field is now poised to study fMRI-derived measures in individual subjects, and to relate these to psychological traits or genetic variations. We discuss issues of validity, reliability and statistical assessment that arise when the focus shifts to individual subjects and that are applicable also to other imaging modalities. We emphasize that individual assessment of neural function with fMRI presents specific challenges and necessitates careful consideration of anatomical and vascular between-subject variability as well as sources of within-subject variability.},

abstract = {Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity studies has yet to be established. This paper introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous functional connectivity. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce functional connectivity patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for functional connectivity analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1000) most accurately represent functional connectivity patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster{\_}roi/. Keywords},

abstract = {Characterization of large-scale brain networks using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging is typically based on the assumption of network stationarity across the duration of scan. Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks (RSNs) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize RSN dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the "oculomotor (OCM) network" strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows ({\textless}60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the OCM network and did not emerge in average RSN analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that RSNs can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure.},

Using a large set of task conditions, spanning several behavioral domains, we train a simple model that relates task-independent measurements to task activity and evaluate the model by predicting task activation maps for unseen subjects using magnetic resonance imaging. Our model can accurately predict individual differences in brain activity and highlights a coupling between brain connectivity and function that can be captured at the level of individual subjects.},

Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed the network comprises multiple, dissociated components. A midline core (posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortex) is active when people make self-relevant, affective decisions. In contrast, a medial temporal lobe subsystem becomes engaged when decisions involve constructing a mental scene based on memory. During certain experimentally directed and spontaneous acts of future-oriented thought, these dissociated components are simultaneously engaged, presumably to facilitate construction of mental models of personally significant events. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The resultant functional maturation curve accounted for 55{\%} of the sample variance and followed a nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape.

We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification, namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of hemodynamic signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville et al. (1999) provided important theoretical and empirical constraints on the form of the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume that underpins the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we combine these system identification and model-based approaches and ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that it can, and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels. To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation. This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the model's validity in relation to empirical nonlinear characterizations of evoked responses in fMRI and other neurophysiological constraints.},

However, the resting state is an uncontrolled condition and its heterogeneity is neither sufficiently understood nor accounted for. We test the hypothesis that subjects exhibit unstable wakefulness, i.e., drift into sleep during typical resting-state experiments. Analyzing 1,147 resting-state functional magnetic resonance data sets, we revealed a reliable loss of wakefulness in a third of subjects within 3min and demonstrated the dynamic nature of the resting state, with fundamental changes in the associated functional neuroanatomy. Implications include the necessity of wakefulness monitoring and modeling, taking measures to maintain a state of wakefulness, acknowledging the possibility of sleep and exploring its consequences, and especially the critical assessment of possible false-positive or false-negative results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Head motion systematically alters correlations in resting state functional connectivity fMRI (RSFC). In this report we examine impact of motion on signal intensity and RSFC correlations. We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10. s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Studies of brain-wide functional connectivity or structural covariance typically use measures like the Pearson correlation coefficient, applied to data that have been averaged across voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). However, averaging across voxels may result in biased connectivity estimates when there is inhomogeneity within those ROIs, e.g., sub-regions that exhibit different patterns of functional connectivity or structural covariance. Here, we propose a new measure based on “distance correlation”; a test of multivariate dependence of high dimensional vectors, which allows for both linear and non-linear dependencies. We used simulations to show how distance correlation out-performs Pearson correlation in the face of inhomogeneous ROIs. To evaluate this new measure on real data, we use resting-state fMRI scans and T1 structural scans from 2 sessions on each of 214 participants from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing {\&} Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project. Pearson correlation and distance correlation showed similar average connectivity patterns, for both functional connectivity and structural covariance. Nevertheless, distance correlation was shown to be 1) more reliable across sessions, 2) more similar across participants, and 3) more robust to different sets of ROIs. Moreover, we found that the similarity between functional connectivity and structural covariance estimates was higher for distance correlation compared to Pearson correlation. We also explored the relative effects of different preprocessing options and motion artefacts on functional connectivity. Because distance correlation is easy to implement and fast to compute, it is a promising alternative to Pearson correlations for investigating ROI-based brain-wide connectivity patterns, for functional as well as structural data.},

It is a common component of aging-related cognitive decline and the behavioral changes associated with neurodegenerative and other brain-related disorders such as traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. Behavioral changes within an individual can reflect alterations at a systems or a cellular level in the brain, and monitoring intra-individual variability can therefore provide a warning of underlying pathology. Despite frequent reports of intra-individual variability, there is little synthesis, and no direct examination of the neural underpinnings. Here, we integrate seminal findings from cognitive research across lifespans of individuals, and also neuropsychological and neurobiological findings, to identify key questions and some potential answers, and to set challenges for fostering future research into intra-individual variability. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper concerns the spatial and intensity transformations that are required to adjust for the confounding effects of subject movement during functional MRI (fMRI) activation studies. An approach is presented that models, and removes, movement-related artifacts from fMRI time-series. This approach is predicated on the observation that movement-related effects are extant even after perfect realignment. Movement-related effects can be divided into those that are a function of position of the object in the frame of reference of the scanner and those that are due to movement in previous scans. This second component depends on the history of excitation experienced by spins in a small volume and consequent differences in local saturation. The spin excitation history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous displacements on the current signal. A model is described as well as the adjustments for movement-related components that ensue. The empirical analyses suggest that (in extreme situations) over 90{\%} of fMRI signal can be attributed to movement, and that this artifactual component can be successfully removed.},

abstract = {Functional and structural maturation of networks comprised of discrete regions is an important aspect of brain development. The default-mode network (DMN) is a prominent network which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTL), and angular gyrus (AG). Despite increasing interest in DMN function, little is known about its maturation from childhood to adulthood. Here we examine developmental changes in DMN connectivity using a multimodal imaging approach by combining resting-state fMRI, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography. We found that the DMN undergoes significant developmental changes in functional and structural connectivity, but these changes are not uniform across all DMN nodes. Convergent structural and functional connectivity analyses suggest that PCC-mPFC connectivity along the cingulum bundle is the most immature link in the DMN of children. Both PCC and mPFC also showed gray matter volume differences, as well as prominent macrostructural and microstructural differences in the dorsal cingulum bundle linking these regions. Notably, structural connectivity between PCC and left MTL was either weak or non-existent in children, even though functional connectivity did not differ from that of adults. These results imply that functional connectivity in children can reach adult-like levels despite weak structural connectivity. We propose that maturation of PCC-mPFC structural connectivity plays an important role in the development of self-related and social-cognitive functions that emerge during adolescence. More generally, our study demonstrates how quantitative multimodal analysis of anatomy and connectivity allows us to better characterize the heterogeneous development and maturation of brain networks. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Independently, we extract the major covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics. We conclude that the full repertoire of functional networks utilized by the brain in action is continuously and dynamically "active" even when at "rest."},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, structural MRI studies have provided remarkable insights into human brain development by revealing the trajectory of gray and white matter maturation from childhood to adolescence and adulthood. In parallel, functional MRI studies have demonstrated changes in brain activation patterns accompanying cognitive development. Despite these advances, studying the maturation of functional brain networks underlying brain development continues to present unique scientific and methodological challenges. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) has emerged as a novel method for investigating the development of large-scale functional brain networks in infants and young children. We review existing rsfMRI developmental studies and discuss how this method has begun to make significant contributions to our understanding of maturing brain organization. In particular, rsfMRI has been used to complement studies in other modalities investigating the emergence of functional segregation and integration across short and long-range connections spanning the entire brain. We show that rsfMRI studies help to clarify and reveal important principles of functional brain development, including a shift from diffuse to focal activation patterns, and simultaneous pruning of local connectivity and strengthening of long-range connectivity with age. The insights gained from these studies also shed light on potentially disrupted functional networks underlying atypical cognitive development associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We conclude by identifying critical gaps in the current literature, discussing methodological issues, and suggesting avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Increased intraindividual variability (IIV) is a hallmark of disorders of attention. Recent work has linked these disorders to abnormalities in a "default mode" network, comprising brain regions routinely deactivated during goal-directed cognitive tasks. Findings from a study of the neural basis of attentional lapses suggest that a competitive relationship between the "task-negative" default mode network and regions of a "task-positive" attentional network is a potential locus of dysfunction in individuals with increased IIV. Resting state studies have shown that this competitive relationship is intrinsically represented in the brain, in the form of a negative correlation or antiphase relationship between spontaneous activity occurring in the two networks. We quantified the negative correlation between these two networks in 26 subjects, during active (Eriksen flanker task) and resting state scans. We hypothesized that the strength of the negative correlation is an index of the degree of regulation of activity in the default mode and task-positive networks and would be positively related to consistent behavioral performance. We found that the strength of the correlation between the two networks varies across individuals. These individual differences appear to be behaviorally relevant, as interindividual variation in the strength of the correlation was significantly related to individual differences in response time variability: the stronger the negative correlation (i.e., the closer to 180?? antiphase), the less variable the behavioral performance. This relationship was moderately consistent across resting and task conditions, suggesting that the measure indexes moderately stable individual differences in the integrity of functional brain networks. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the behavioral significance of spontaneous brain activity, in both healthy and clinical populations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1 is acquiring high-quality in vivo macroscopic-level connectome imaging data from over a thousand healthy adult subjects in an effort to elucidate the neural pathways and networks that underlie brain function and behavior. An overarching aim is to reveal much about what makes us uniquely human and what makes individuals different from each other by understanding how brain networks integrate information through the complex pattern of neural connections. To date, data sets from 500 subjects have been publicly released, including imaging data measuring functional and structural brain connectivity, as well as 280 non-imaging subject measures (SMs), including demographics (age, sex, income, education level, drug use, etc.), psychometrics (IQ, language performance, etc.) and other behavioral measures such as 'rule-breaking behavior' . We sought to relate functional connectomes to behavior in a single integrated analysis. This goes further than simply investigating which SMs correlate with other SMs; we wanted to discover whether any specific patterns of brain connectivity are associated with specific sets of correlated demographics and behavior, as brain-behavior modes of population co-variation. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 461 HCP subjects, and network modeling tools from FSL (FMRIB Software Library). A population-average brain parcellation was estimated using independent component analysis 2 , yielding 200 distinct brain regions; these constitute the nodes in our network modeling. The functional connections (edges) between these nodes were estimated using Tikhonov-regularized partial correlation, resulting in a 200 × 200 connectome for each subject. These connec-tomes were combined into a single large connectome matrix (con-taining all connectomes from all subjects; Supplementary Fig. 1). Separately, 158 behavioral and demographic non-imaging SMs from the same set of subjects were formed into a subject measure matrix. We regressed potential confounds (including brain size and head motion) out of both matrices. Redundancies among connectomes and SMs were reduced by (separately) keeping just the first 100 principal components of each matrix. A natural choice of method for investigating underlying relation-ships between two sets of variables is canonical correlation analysis (CCA) 3 , a procedure that seeks maximal correlations between com-binations of variables in both sets. Using CCA, we estimated pairs of canonical variates along which sets of SMs and patterns of brain con-nectivity co-vary in a similar way across subjects. We refer to each such pair of variates as a mode of co-variation. Strict tests were applied to avoid over-fitting and false-positive inflation. Statistical significance was determined with a permutation test that accounted for the fam-ily structure of the HCP data 4 . This analysis revealed a single highly significant CCA mode that relates functional connectomes to subject measures (r = 0.87, P {\textless} 10 −5 corrected for multiple comparisons across all modes estimated). These analyses were driven by and report only correlations; inferring and interpreting the (presumably complex and diverse) causalities remains a challenging issue for the future.},

From the initial discovery of the syndrome, associated developmental delays made it clear that changes in brain development were a key part of the expression. Once patients were followed through childhood into adult years, further neurobehavioural phenotypes became apparent, including a changing cognitive profile, anxiety disorders and seizure diathesis. The variability of expression is as wide as for the myriad physical features associated with the syndrome, with the addition of evolving phenotype over the developmental trajectory. Notably, variability appears unrelated to length of the associated deletion. Several mouse models of the deletion have been engineered and are beginning to reveal potential molecular mechanisms for the cognitive and behavioural phenotypes observable in animals. Both animal and human studies hold great promise for further discoveries relevant to neurodevelopment and associated cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Velocardiofacial syndrome, caused by a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2, is often accompanied by cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric impairments. Specifically, velocardiofacial syndrome has been proposed as a disease model for a genetically mediated subtype of schizophrenia. Velocardiofacial syndrome is also known to affect brain structure. The most prominent structural findings in velocardiofacial syndrome are reduced white matter volumes. However, the structure of white matter and extent of specific regional involvement in this syndrome have never been investigated. The current study used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate white matter structure in children and young adults with velocardiofacial syndrome. METHOD: Nineteen participants with velocardiofacial syndrome and 19 age- and gender-matched comparison subjects underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. Whole brain voxel-by-voxel analyses were conducted to investigate white matter fractional anisotropy differences between the groups. RESULTS: Relative to the comparison group, the velocardiofacial syndrome group had reduced white matter anisotropy in the frontal, parietal, and temporal regions as well as in tracts connecting the frontal and temporal lobes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that alterations of white matter tract structure occur in velocardiofacial syndrome. Reduced white matter anisotropy was observed in individuals with velocardiofacial syndrome in areas previously implicated in the neurocognitive phenotype of velocardiofacial syndrome. The finding of aberrant parietal white matter tracts as well as aberrant frontotemporal connectivity in velocardiofacial syndrome and in previous schizophrenia studies may be associated with increased vulnerability for development of psychotic symptoms.},

abstract = {Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disease known to lead to cerebral structural alterations, which we study using the framework of the macroscopic white-matter connectome. We create weighted connectomes of 44 patients with 22q11DS and 44 healthy controls using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, and perform a weighted graph theoretical analysis. After confirming global network integration deficits in 22q11DS (previously identified using binary connectomes), we identify the spatial distribution of regions responsible for global deficits. Next, we further characterize the dysconnectivity of the deficient regions in terms of sub-network properties, and investigate their relevance with respect to clinical profiles. We define the subset of regions with decreased nodal integration (evaluated using the closeness centrality measure) as the affected core (A-core) of the 22q11DS structural connectome. A-core regions are broadly bilaterally symmetric and consist of numerous network hubs - chiefly parietal and frontal cortical, as well as subcortical regions. Using a simulated lesion approach, we demonstrate that these core regions and their connections are particularly important to efficient network communication. Moreover, these regions are generally densely connected, but less so in 22q11DS. These specific disturbances are associated to a rerouting of shortest network paths that circumvent the A-core in 22q11DS, "de-centralizing" the network. Finally, the efficiency and mean connectivity strength of an orbito-frontal/cingulate circuit, included in the affected regions, correlate negatively with the extent of negative symptoms in 22q11DS patients, revealing the clinical relevance of present findings. The identified A-core overlaps numerous regions previously identified as affected in 22q11DS as well as in schizophrenia, which approximately 30-40{\%} of 22q11DS patients develop.},

@article{Oskarsdottir2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Almost all cases of DiGeorge syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome result from a common deletion of chromosome 22q11.2. These syndromes are usually referred to as the 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which has a wide phenotypic spectrum and an estimated incidence of one in 4000 births. AIMS: To assess the incidence and prevalence of the 22q11 deletion syndrome in the Western G{\"{o}}taland Region of western Sweden METHODS: Children below 16 years of age with 22q11DS in a well defined catchment area and population of the Western G{\"{o}}taland Region were recruited. Diagnosis of 22q11DS was confirmed using a FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) test. Proven 22q11 deletion was the demonstration of one signal in 11 metaphase spreads with fair quality. RESULTS: During the study period in the Western G{\"{o}}taland Region the mean annual incidence of 22q11DS was 14.1 per 100 000 live births. During the first five years the incidence was 18.1 per 100 000 live births for the whole region and 23.4 per 100 000 live births in Gothenburg, where a multidisciplinary specialist team for 22q11 DS is based. The prevalence was 13.2 per 100 000 children below 16 years of age in the whole region and 23.3 per 100 000 in Gothenburg. CONCLUSION: The number of individuals diagnosed depends on the experience and awareness of the syndrome among specialists who encounter these children and also the severity of the phenotype. The higher frequency of 22q11DS found in Gothenburg is an example of increased awareness. The true incidence and prevalence of this syndrome will only be found through population-based screening, but this would be too expensive and ethically questionable. Screening of specific risk populations would be more justified.},

abstract = {The insula is a brain structure implicated in disparate cognitive, affective, and regulatory functions, including interoceptive awareness, emotional responses, and empathic processes. While classically considered a limbic region, recent evidence from network analysis suggests a critical role for the insula, particularly the anterior division, in high-level cognitive control and attentional processes. The crucial insight and view we present here is of the anterior insula as an integral hub in mediating dynamic interactions between other large-scale brain networks involved in externally oriented attention and internally oriented or self-related cognition. The model we present postulates that the insula is sensitive to salient events, and that its core function is to mark such events for additional processing and initiate appropriate control signals. The anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex form a "salience network" that functions to segregate the most relevant among internal and extrapersonal stimuli in order to guide behavior. Within the framework of our network model, the disparate functions ascribed to the insula can be conceptualized by a few basic mechanisms: (1) bottom-up detection of salient events, (2) switching between other large-scale networks to facilitate access to attention and working memory resources when a salient event is detected, (3) interaction of the anterior and posterior insula to modulate autonomic reactivity to salient stimuli, and (4) strong functional coupling with the anterior cingulate cortex that facilitates rapid access to the motor system. In this manner, with the insula as its integral hub, the salience network assists target brain regions in the generation of appropriate behavioral responses to salient stimuli. We suggest that this framework provides a parsimonious account of insula function in neurotypical adults, and may provide novel insights into the neural basis of disorders of affective and social cognition.},

abstract = {In proactive interference (PI) paradigms, previous learning impairs the acquisition of new, related information. In rats, efficient resolution of PI relies on cholinergic modulation from the basal forebrain (BF). To test whether humans resolve PI using a functional network dependent on the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB) nuclei of the BF, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging signal recorded while human participants learned to respond to baseline color paired associates and then additional pairs that interfered with the baseline pairs. Multivariate, partial least-squares analysis supported a MS/DB-dependent functional network: MS/DB activity covaried with activity in areas important to selective attention, including intraparietal sulcus, and memory that are direct cholinergic efferents of the MS/DB, including the hippocampus, as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, implicated in PI resolution. This network was associated with effective PI-resolution behavior. A second network also correlated with PI resolution but appearing not to be driven by the MS/DB, included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with compromised BF function did not engage the MS/DB-dependent network reliably; instead their PI-resolution behavior was well explained by the second network. Thus, 2 functional networks may underly a single cognitive function; when the MS/DB-dependent attention/memory integration network is compromised, an alternate network is available to maintain normal levels of performance.},

Here we examined correlations in spontaneous blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations in a resting state to identify the network associated with the hippocampal formation (HF) and determine whether parietal regions were elements of that network. In the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit mnemonic demands, robust correlations were observed between activity in the HF and several parietal regions (including precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule). These HF-correlated regions in parietal cortex were spatially distinct from those correlated with the motion-sensitive MT+ complex. Reanalysis of event-related fMRI studies of recognition memory showed that the regions spontaneously correlated with the HF (but not MT+) were also modulated during directed recollection. These regions showed greater activity to successfully recollected items as compared with other trial types. Together, these results associate specific regions of parietal cortex that are sensitive to successful recollection with the HF.},

Such changes enhance information processing capacity, which can be indexed by estimation of neural signal complexity. Here, we show that during development, EEG signal complexity increases from one month to 5 years of age in response to auditory and visual stimulation. However, the rates of change in complexity were not equivalent for the two responses. Infants' signal complexity for the visual condition was greater than auditory signal complexity, whereas adults showed the same level of complexity to both types of stimuli. The differential rates of complexity change may reflect a combination of innate and experiential factors on the structure and function of the two sensory systems.},

abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) analysis has been used to characterize distributed signals measured by neuroimaging methods like positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potentials (ERP) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In the application to PET, it has been used to extract activity patterns differentiating cognitive tasks, patterns relating distributed activity to behavior, and to describe large-scale interregional interactions or functional connections. This paper reviews the more recent extension of PLS to the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns present in fMRI, ERP, and MEG data. We present a basic mathematical description of PLS and discuss the statistical assessment using permutation testing and bootstrap resampling. These two resampling methods provide complementary information of the statistical strength of the extracted activity patterns (permutation test) and the reliability of regional contributions to the patterns (bootstrap resampling). Simulated ERP data are used to guide the basic interpretation of spatiotemporal PLS results, and examples from empirical ERP and fMRI data sets are used for further illustration. We conclude with a discussion of some caveats in the use of PLS, including nonlinearities, nonorthogonality, and interpretation difficulties. We further discuss its role as an important tool in a pluralistic analytic approach to neuroimaging. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The behavioural phenotype of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome syndrome (22q11DS), one of the most common human multiple anomaly syndromes, frequently includes intellectual disability (ID) together with high risk of diagnosis of psychotic disorders including schizophrenia. Candidate cognitive endophenotypes include problems with retrieval of contextual information from memory and in executive control and focussing of attention. 22q11DS may offer a model of the relationship between ID and risk of psychiatric disorder. This paper reviews research on the relationship between the cognitive phenotype and the development of psychiatric disorders in 22q11DS. Aspects of cognitive function including verbal I.Q., visual memory, and executive function, are associated with mental health outcome in people with 22q11DS. This relationship may result from a common neurobiological basis for the cognitive difficulties and psychiatric disorders. Some of the cognitive difficulties experienced by people with 22q11DS, especially in attention, memory retrieval, and face processing, may, however, in themselves constitute risk factors for development of hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Future research into factors leading to psychiatric disorder in people with 22q11DS should include assessment of social and psychological factors including life events, symptoms associated with trauma, attachment, and self-esteem, which together with cognitive risk factors may mediate mental health outcome.},

@article{Ghosh2008,
abstract = {Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1-100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, {\textless}0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space-time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.},

At the level of large-scale neural systems, as measured with functional MRI (fMRI), this ongoing activity reflects the organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called resting-state networks (RSNs) closely relate to the underlying anatomical connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the emerging RSNs.

abstract = {Early in life, brain development carries with it a large number of structural changes that impact the functional interactions of distributed neuronal networks. Such changes enhance information processing capacity, moving the brain from a deterministic system to one that is more stochastic. The evidence from empirical studies with EEG and functional MRI suggests that this stochastic property is a result of an increased number of possible functional network configurations for a given situation. This is captured in the variability of endogenous and evoked responses or "brain noise ". In empirical data from infants and children, brain noise increases with maturation and correlates positively with stable behavior and accuracy. The noise increase is best explained through increased noise from network level interactions with a concomitant decrease of local noise. In old adults, brain noise continues to change, although the pattern of changes is not as global as in early development. The relation between high brain noise and stable behavior is maintained, but the relationships differ by region, suggesting changes in local dynamics that then impact potential network configurations. These data, when considered in concert with our extant modeling work, suggest that maturational changes in brain noise represent the enhancement offunctional network potential--the brain's dynamic repertoire.},

abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations--e.g., random noise--cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being "suboptimal". Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the "neural code". Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise--via stochastic resonance or otherwise--than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing "noise benefits", and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are 'Bayes' optimal'. This leads to the 'Bayesian coding hypothesis': that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present study examined directional connections in the brain among resting-state networks (RSNs) when the participant had their eyes open (EO) or had their eyes closed (EC). The resting-state fMRI data were collected from 20 healthy participants (9 males, 20.17 ± 2.74 years) under the EO and EC states. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to identify the separated RSNs (i.e., the primary/high-level visual, primary sensory-motor, ventral motor, salience/dorsal attention, and anterior/posterior default- mode networks), and the Gaussian Bayesian network (BN) learning approach was then used to explore the conditional dependencies among these RSNs. The network-to-network directional connections related to EO and ECwere depicted, and a support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to identify the directional connection patterns that could effectively discriminate between the two states. The results indicated that the connections among RSNs are directionally connected within a BN during the EO and EC states. The directional connections from the salience network (SN) to the anterior/posterior default- mode networks and the high-level to primary-level visual network were the obvious characteristics of both the EO and EC resting-state BNs. Of the directional connections in BN, the directional connections of the salience and dorsal attention network (DAN)were observed to be discriminative between the EO and EC states. In particular, we noted that the properties of the salience and DANs were in opposite directions. Overall, the present study described the directional connections of RSNs using a BN learning approach during the EO and EC states, and the results suggested that the directionality of the attention systems (i.e., mainly for the salience and the DAN) in resting state might have important roles in switching between the EO and EC conditions.},

abstract = {The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia has been associated with abnormal task-related brain activation in sensory and motor regions as well as social cognition network. Recently, two studies investigated temporal correlation between resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in schizophrenia but reported mixed results. This may be due to the different frequency bands used in these studies. Here we utilized R-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in three different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz; and typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy controls. We showed that there were significant differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two bands (slow-5 and slow-4) in regions including basal ganglia, midbrain, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, we also identified significant interaction between frequency bands and groups in inferior occipital gyrus, precuneus, and thalamus. The results suggest that the abnormalities of LFOs in schizophrenia is dependent on the frequency band and suggest that future studies should take the different frequency bands into account when measure intrinsic brain activity.},

abstract = {This paper describes DARTEL, which is an algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website. ?? 2009.},

Measuring structural covariance with MRI is a well-established approach to investigate common changes in distinct systems. We investigated structural covariance in schizophrenia in a large Brazilian sample of individuals with chronic schizophrenia (n = 143), First Episode Psychosis (n = 32), and matched healthy controls (n = 82) using a combination of graph analysis and computational neuroanatomy.Firstly, we proposed the connectivity-closeness and integrity-closeness centrality measures and them compared healthy controls with chronic schizophrenia regarding these metrics. We then conducted a second analysis on the mapped regions comparing the pairwise difference between the three groups. Our results show that compared with controls, both patient groups (in pairwise comparisons) had a reduced integrity-closeness in pars orbitalis and insula, suggesting that the relationship between these areas and other brain regions is increased in schizophrenia. No differences were found between the First Episode Psychosis and Schizophrenia groups. Since in schizophrenia the brain is affected as a whole, this may mirror that these regions may be related to the generalized structural alteration seen in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {As the brain matures, its responses become optimized. Behavioral measures show this through improved accuracy and decreased trial-to-trial variability. The question remains whether the supporting brain dynamics show a similar decrease in variability. We examined the relation between variability in single trial evoked electrical activity of the brain (measured with EEG) and performance of a face memory task in children (8-15 y) and young adults (20-33 y). Behaviorally, children showed slower, more variable response times (RT), and less accurate recognition than adults. However, brain signal variability increased with age, and showed strong negative correlations with intrasubject RT variability and positive correlations with accuracy. Thus, maturation appears to lead to a brain with greater functional variability, which is indicative of enhanced neural complexity. This variability may reflect a broader repertoire of metastable brain states and more fluid transitions among them that enable optimum responses. Our results suggest that the moment-to-moment variability in brain activity may be a critical index of the cognitive capacity of the brain.},

Just like BOLD fluctuations, infraslow and slow fluctuations in the EEG signal from sensorimotor pairs of electrodes were positively correlated, whereas no such correlation was observed in signals from sensorimotor-control pairs. The correlation also occurred across arousal states. The results make clear that both BOLD and ECoG fluctuations exhibit a pattern of regional correlations, or functional connectivity, which closely reflects the regions' anatomical connectivity. They also raise questions about the origin of infraslow fluctuations, the role of spontaneous activity in the adult brain, and the association of gamma activity with consciousness.},

Volumes of the caudate nucleus and subregions of the frontal lobe were compared on magnetic resonance images of 10 children with velocardiofacial syndrome and 10 age- and gender-matched controls. Frontal deep white matter was reduced significantly (by about 23{\%}) in subjects with velocardiofacial syndrome relative to controls. Frontal and prefrontal volumes were also reduced in subjects with velocardiofacial syndrome, although not disproportionately to whole brain volume.

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging measures of cerebral volume, cortical thickness, surface area, and an index of local gyrification were obtained and compared between groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Patients with 22q11DS demonstrated global increases in cortical thickness associated with reductions in surface area, reduced index of local gyrification, and lower cerebral volumes relative to typically developing controls. Findings were principally in the frontal lobe, superior parietal lobes, and in the paramedian cerebral cortex. Focally decreased thickness was seen in the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex in 22q11DS relative to nondeleted groups. Patterns between nondeleted participants with psychotic symptoms and 22q11DS were similar but with important differences in several regions implicated in schizophrenia. Post hoc analysis suggested that like the 22q11DS group, cortical thickness in nondeleted individuals with psychotic symptoms differed from typically developing controls in the superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, regions previously linked to schizophrenia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous examination of multiple measures of cerebral architecture demonstrates that differences in 22q11DS localize to regions of the frontal, superior parietal, superior temporal, and paramidline cerebral cortex.

abstract = {Introduction: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) represents one of the largest known genetic risk factors for psychosis, yet the neurobiological mechanisms underlying symptom development are not well understood. Here we conducted a cross-sectional study of 22q11DS to decompose cortical volume into its constituent parts, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), which are believed to have distinct neurodevelopmental origins. Methods: High-resolution T1-weighted scans were collected on 65 participants (31 22q11DS, 34 demographically comparable typically developing controls, 10-25 years old). Measures of cortical volume, CT, and SA were extracted from regions of interest using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite. Group differences and age-related trajectories in these structures, as well as their association with psychotic symptomatology, were assessed. Results: Relative to controls, 22q11DS participants showed bilateral volumetric reductions in the inferior temporal cortex, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, superior parietal cortex, and cuneus, which were driven by decreased SA in these regions. 22q11DS participants also had increased volumes, driven by increased CT, in bilateral insula regions. 22q11DS youth had increased CT in frontal regions, particularly middle frontal and medial orbitofrontal cortices. A pattern of age-associated cortical thinning was observed in typically developing controls in brain regions associated with visual and sensory information-processing (i.e., left pericalcarine cortex and fusiform gyrus, right lingual and postcentral cortices). However, this relationship was disrupted in 22q11DS participants. Finally, correlational analyses revealed that increased CT in right medial orbitofrontal cortex was associated with increased positive symptom severity in 22q11DS. Conclusion: Differential disruptions of CT and SA in distinct cortical regions in 22q11DS may indicate abnormalities in distinct developmental neural processes. Further, neuroanatomic abnormalities in medial frontal brain structures disproportionately affected in idiopathic schizophrenia were associated with psychotic symptom severity in 22q11DS youth, suggesting that disrupted biological processes in these cortical regions may underlie development of psychotic symptoms, both in 22q11DS and in the broader population. ?? 2013 The Authors.

While we are far from a complete understanding, these studies have yielded important insights into human brain development. There is an ever growing variety of methods for assessing connectivity, each with its own advantages. Here we review research on the development of structural and/or functional brain connectivity in both typically developing subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders. Space limitations preclude an exhaustive review of brain connectivity across all developmental disorders, so we review a representative selection of recent findings on brain connectivity in autism, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, and ADHD. Major strides have been made in understanding the developmental trajectory of the human connectome, offering insight into characteristic features of brain development and biological processes involved in developmental brain disorders. We also discuss some common themes, including hemispheric specialization - or asymmetry - and sex differences. We conclude by discussing some promising future directions in connectomics, including the merger of imaging and genetics, and a deeper investigation of the relationships between structural and functional connectivity. ?? 2013 ISDN.},

abstract = {22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent genetic mutation that is highly penetrant for psychosis. Behavioral research suggests that 22q11DS patients exhibit a characteristic neurocognitive phenotype that includes differential impairment in spatial working memory (WM). Notably, spatial WM has also been proposed as an endophenotype for idiopathic psychotic disorder, yet little is known about the neurobiological substrates of WM in 22q11DS. In order to investigate the neural systems engaged during spatial WM in 22q11DS patients, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while 41 participants (16 22q11DS patients, 25 demographically matched controls) performed a spatial capacity WM task that included manipulations of delay length and load level. Relative to controls, 22q11DS patients showed reduced neural activation during task performance in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and superior frontal sulcus (SFS). In addition, the typical increases in neural activity within spatial WM-relevant regions with greater memory load were not observed in 22q11DS. We further investigated whether neural dysfunction during WM was associated with behavioral WM performance, assessed via the University of Maryland letter-number sequencing (LNS) task, and positive psychotic symptoms, assessed via the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS), in 22q11DS patients. WM load activity within IPS and SFS was positively correlated with LNS task performance; moreover, WM load activity within IPS was inversely correlated with the severity of unusual thought content and delusional ideas, indicating that decreased recruitment of working memory-associated neural circuitry is associated with more severe positive symptoms. These results suggest that 22q11DS patients show reduced neural recruitment of brain regions critical for spatial WM function, which may be related to characteristic behavioral manifestations of the disorder. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic mutation associated with disorders of cortical connectivity and social dysfunction. However, little is known about the functional connectivity (FC) of the resting brain in 22q11DS and its relationship with social behavior. A seed-based analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was used to investigate FC associated with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), in (26) youth with 22qDS and (51) demographically matched controls. Subsequently, the relationship between PCC connectivity and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores was examined in 22q11DS participants. Relative to 22q11DS participants, controls showed significantly stronger FC between the PCC and other default mode network (DMN) nodes, including the precuneus, precentral gyrus and left frontal pole. 22q11DS patients did not show age-associated FC changes observed in typically developing controls. Increased connectivity between PCC, medial prefrontal regions and the anterior cingulate cortex, was associated with lower SRS scores (i.e. improved social competence) in 22q11DS. DMN integrity may play a key role in social information processing. We observed disrupted DMN connectivity in 22q11DS, paralleling reports from idiopathic autism and schizophrenia. Increased strength of long-range DMN connectivity was associated with improved social functioning in 22q11DS. These findings support a 'developmental-disconnection' hypothesis of symptom development in this disorder.},

abstract = {Dynamics of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide a new window onto the organizational principles of brain function. Using state-of-the-art signal processing techniques, we extract innovation-driven co-activation patterns (iCAPs) from resting-state fMRI. The iCAPs' maps are spatially overlapping and their sustained-activity signals temporally overlapping. Decomposing resting-state fMRI using iCAPs reveals the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble known resting-state networks. The temporal overlap between iCAPs is substantial; typically, three to four iCAPs occur simultaneously in combinations that are consistent with their behaviour profiles. In contrast to conventional connectivity analysis, which suggests a negative correlation between fluctuations in the default-mode network (DMN) and task-positive networks, we instead find evidence for two DMN-related iCAPs consisting the posterior cingulate cortex that differentially interact with the attention network. These findings demonstrate how the fMRI resting state can be functionally decomposed into spatially and temporally overlapping building blocks using iCAPs.},

Many noninvasive imaging modalities have been developed, such as topographical techniques based on the electromagnetic field potential [i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)], and tomography approaches including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here we will focus on functional MRI (fMRI) since it is widely deployed for clinical and cognitive neurosciences today, and it can reveal brain function due to neurovascular coupling (see ?From Brain Images to fMRI Time Series?). It has led to a much better understanding of brain function, including the description of brain areas with very specialized functions such as face recognition. These neuroscientific insights have been made possible by important methodological advances in MR physics, signal processing, and mathematical modeling.},

abstract = {Confirmatory approaches to fMRI data analysis look for evidence for the presence of pre-defined regressors modeling contributions to the voxel time series, including the BOLD response following neuronal activation. As more complicated questions arise about brain function, such as spontaneous and resting-state activity, new methodologies are required. We propose total activation (TA) as a novel fMRI data analysis method to explore the underlying activity-inducing signal of the BOLD signal without any timing information that is based on sparse spatio-temporal priors and characterization of the hemodynamic system. Within a variational framework, we formulate a convex cost function-including spatial and temporal regularization terms-that is solved by fast iterative shrinkage algorithms. The temporal regularization expresses that the activity-inducing signal is block-type without restrictions on the timing nor duration. The spatial regularization favors coherent activation patterns in anatomically-defined brain regions. TA is evaluated using a software phantom and an event-related fMRI experiment with prolonged resting state periods disturbed by visual stimuli. The results illustrate that both block-type and spike-type activities can be recovered successfully without prior knowledge of the experimental paradigm. Further processing using hierarchical clustering shows that the activity-inducing signals revealed by TA contain information about meaningful task-related and resting-state networks, demonstrating good abilities for the study of non-stationary dynamics of brain activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NF) facilitates voli- tional control over brain activity and themodulation of associated mental functions. The NF signals of traditional rtfMRI-NF studies predominantly reflect neuronal activity within ROIs. In this study, we describe a novel rtfMRI-NF approach that includes a func- tional connectivity (FC) component in the NF signal (FC-added rtfMRI-NF). We estimated the efficacy of the FC-added rtfMRI- NF method by applying it to nicotine-dependent heavy smokers in an effort to reduce cigarette craving. ACC and medial pFC as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus are asso- ciated with cigarette craving and were chosen as ROIs. Fourteen heavy smokers were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of NF: traditional activity-based rtfMRI-NF or FC-added rtfMRI-NF. Participants received rtfMRI-NF training during two separate visits after overnight smoking cessation, and cigarette craving score was assessed. The FC-added rtfMRI-NF resulted in greater neuronal activity and increased FC between the targeted ROIs than the traditional activity-based rtfMRI-NF and resulted in lower craving score. In the FC-added rtfMRI-NF condition, the average of neuronal activity and FC was tightly associated with craving score (Bonferroni-corrected p = .028). However, in the activity-based rtfMRI-NF condition, no association was detected (uncorrected p {\textgreater} .081). Non-rtfMRI data analysis also showed enhanced neuronal activity and FC with FC-added NF than with activity-based NF. These results demonstrate that FC-added rtfMRI-NF facilitates greater volitional control over brain activity and connectivity and greater modulation ofmental function than activity-based rtfMRI-NF.},

abstract = {We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data. Advances in calcium imaging pose significant statistical analysis challenges. Pnevmatikakis et al. present a method for identifying and spatially demixing imaged neural components and deconvolving their activity from the indicator dynamics. The method is applied to a variety of datasets.},

@article{Fair2007,
abstract = {Human attentional control is unrivaled. We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter "integration" of some regions into networks over time while "segregating" other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity MRI, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.},

abstract = {We examined the status of the neural network mediating the default mode of brain function, which typically exhibits greater activation during rest than during task, in patients in the early phase of schizophrenia and in young first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia. During functional MRI, patients, rel- atives, and controls alternated between rest and performance of working memory (WM) tasks. As expected, controls exhibited task-related suppression of activation in the default network, including medial pref rontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Patients and relatives exhibited significantly reduced task-related suppression in MPFC, and these reductions remained after controlling for performance. Increased task-related MPFC suppression correlated with better WM performance in patients and relatives and with less psychopathology in all 3 groups. For WM task performance, patients and relatives had greater activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than controls. During rest and task, patients and relatives exhibited abnormally high functional connectivity within the default net- work. The magnitudes of default network connectivity during rest and task correlated with psychopathology in the patients. Further, during both rest and task, patients exhibited reduced anticorrela- tions between MPFC and DLPFC, a region that was hyperactivated by patients and relatives during WM performance. Among pa- tients, the magnitude of MPFC task suppression negatively corre- lated with default connectivity, suggesting an association between the hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity in schizophrenia. Hy- peractivation (reduced task-related suppression) of default regions and hyperconnectivity of the default network may contribute to Hfctiirhanrpc of thru in ht in «chizonhrenia and risk for the illness.},

abstract = {The panoply of cognitive, affective, motivational, and social functions that underpin everyday human experience requires precisely choreographed patterns of interaction between networked brain regions. Perhaps not surprisingly, diverse forms of psychopathology are characterized by breakdowns in these interregional relationships. Here, we discuss how functional brain imaging has provided insights into the nature of brain dysconnectivity in mental illness. Synthesizing work to date, we propose that genetic and environmental risk factors impinge upon systems-level circuits for several core dimensions of cognition, producing transdiagnostic symptoms. We argue that risk-associated disruption of these circuits mediates susceptibility to broad domains of psychopathology rather than discrete disorders. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is increasingly thought of as a brain network or connectome disorder and is associated with neurodevelopmental processes. Previous studies have suggested the important role of anatomical distance in developing a connectome with optimized performance regarding both the cost and efficiency of information processing. Distance-related disturbances during development have not been investigated in schizophrenia. To test the distance-related miswiring profiles of connectomes in schizophrenia, we acquired resting-state images from 20 adulthood-onset (AOS) and 26 early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients, as well as age-matched healthy controls. All patients were drug naive and had experienced their first psychotic episode. A novel threshold-free surface-based analytic framework was developed to examine local-to-remote functional connectivity profiles in both AOS and EOS patients. We observed consistent increases of local connectivity across both EOS and AOS patients in the right superior frontal gyrus, where the connectivity strength was correlated with a positive syndrome score in AOS patients. In contrast, EOS but not AOS patients exhibited reduced local connectivity within the right postcentral gyrus and the left middle occipital cortex. These regions' remote connectivity with their interhemispheric areas and brain network hubs was altered. Diagnosis-age interactions were detectable for both local and remote connectivity profiles. The functional covariance between local and remote homotopic connectivity was present in typically developing controls, but was absent in EOS patients. These findings suggest that a distance-dependent miswiring pattern may be one of the key neurodevelopmental features of the abnormal connectome organization in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods are particularly suited to the analysis of relationships between measures of brain activity and of behavior or experimental design. In neuroimaging, PLS refers to two related methods: (1) symmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC), and (2) asymmetric PLS or Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). The most popular (by far) version of PLS for neuroimaging is PLSC. It exists in several varieties based on the type of data that are related to brain activity: behavior PLSC analyzes the relationship between brain activity and behavioral data, task PLSC analyzes how brain activity relates to pre-defined categories or experimental design, seed PLSC analyzes the pattern of connectivity between brain regions, and multi-block or multi-table PLSC integrates one or more of these varieties in a common analysis. PLSR, in contrast to PLSC, is a predictive technique which, typically, predicts behavior (or design) from brain activity. For both PLS methods, statistical inferences are implemented using cross-validation techniques to identify significant patterns of voxel activation. This paper presents both PLS methods and illustrates them with small numerical examples and typical applications in neuroimaging. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Since Freud, clinicians have understood that disturbing memories contribute to psychopathology and that new emotional experiences contribute to therapeutic change. Yet, controversy remains about what is truly essential to bring about psychotherapeutic change. Mounting evidence from empirical studies suggests that emotional arousal is a key ingredient in therapeutic change in many modalities. In addition, memory seems to play an important role but there is a lack of consensus on the role of understanding what happened in the past in bringing about therapeutic change. The core idea of this paper is that therapeutic change in a variety of modalities, including behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, results from the updating of prior emotional memories through a process of reconsolidation that incorporates new emotional experiences. We present an integrated memory model with three interactive components – autobiographical (event) memories, semantic structures, and emotional responses – supported by emerging evidence from cognitive neuroscience on implicit and explicit emotion, implicit and explicit memory, emotion-memory interactions, memory reconsolidation, and the relationship between autobiographical and semantic memory. We propose that the essential ingredients of therapeutic change include: (1) reactivating old memories; (2) engaging in new emotional experiences that are incorporated into these reactivated memories via the process of reconsolidation; and (3) reinforcing the integrated memory structure by practicing a new way of behaving and experiencing the world in a variety of contexts. The implications of this new, neurobiologically grounded synthesis for research, clinical practice, and teaching are discussed.},

abstract = {Pairing a previously neutral conditioned stimulus (CS; e.g., a tone) to an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US; e.g., a footshock) leads to associative learning such that the tone alone comes to elicit a conditioned response (e.g., freezing). We have previously shown that an extinction session that occurs within the reconsolidation window attenuates fear responding and prevents the return of fear in pure tone Pavlovian fear conditioning. Here we sought to examine whether this effect also applies to a more complex fear memory. First, we show that after fear conditioning to the simultaneous presentation of a tone and a light (T+L) coterminating with a shock, the compound memory that ensues is more resistant to fear extinction than simple tone-shock pairings. Next, we demonstrate that the compound memory can be disrupted by interrupting the reconsolidation of the two individual components using a sequential retrieval+extinction paradigm, provided the stronger compound component is retrieved first. These findings provide insight into how compound memories are encoded, and could have important implications for PTSD treatment.},

abstract = {There are two research traditions on dynamic memory processes. In cognitive psychology, the malleable nature of long-term memory has been extensively documented. Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hand, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again.},

In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

This article focuses on the cortical gyrification changes that are associated with the genetic disorder in 6-15-year-old children with 22q11.2DS, when compared with a group of age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Local gyrification index (lGI; Schaer et al. [2008]: IEEE Trans Med Imaging 27:161-170) was used to characterize the cortical gyrification at each vertex of the pial surface. Vertex-wise statistical analysis of lGI differences between the two groups revealed cortical areas of significant reduction in cortical gyrification in children with 22q11.2DS, which were mainly distributed along the medial aspect of each hemisphere. To gain further insight into the developmental trajectory of the cortical gyrification, we examined age as a factor in lGI changes over the 6-15 years of development, within and across the two groups of children. Our primary results pertaining to the developmental trajectory of cortical gyrification revealed cortical regions where the change in lGI over the 6-15 years of age was significantly modulated by diagnosis, implying an atypical development of cortical gyrification in children with 22q11.2DS, when compared with the TD children. Significantly, these cortical areas included parietal structures that are associated, in typical individuals, with visuospatial, attentional, and numerical cognition tasks in which children with 22q11.2DS show impairments.},

Better identifying risk factors for the emergence of psychotic symptoms in this population is needed to improve clinical assessment and early interventions. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, hallucinations and delusions were characterized in an original sample of 104 individuals with 22q11DS. Further analysis of positive and negative symptoms was performed in a subsample of 59 individuals. Finally, longitudinal data available in 56 patients were used to explore the developmental trajectories of psychotic symptoms as well as the associations between psychotic symptoms and cognitive functioning. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders and psychotic symptoms were frequent in adolescent and adults with 22q11DS. The severity of hallucinations and non-persecutory delusional ideas discriminated patients at ultra-high risk for conversion to psychosis. Whereas approximately one-third of patients experienced an emergence of psychotic symptoms during a 4-year interval, 20 {\%} displayed transient symptoms. Individuals with psychotic symptoms were characterized by a lower cognitive functioning in the context of the 22q11DS. The present study adds important data on the characteristics and developmental trajectory of psychotic symptoms in this population. This information may ultimately help clinicians dealing with these patients to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis and improve outcome.},

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.},

@article{Greicius2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of major depression have revealed resting-state abnormalities in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity within a specific resting-state neural network--the default-mode network--that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression and in healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with major depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on functional connectivity. RESULTS: Resting-state subgenual cingulate and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore default-mode functional connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative, resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual subjects.},

abstract = {Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the brain is remarkably active even in the absence of overt behavior, and this activity occurs in spatial patterns that are reproducible across subjects and follow the brain's established functional subdivision. Investigating the distribution of these spatial patterns is an active area of research with the goal of obtaining a better understanding of the neural networks underlying brain function. One intriguing aspect of spontaneous activity is an apparent nonstationarity, or variability of interaction between brain regions. It was recently proposed that spontaneous brain activity may be dominated by brief traces of activity, possibly originating from a neuronal avalanching phenomenon. Such traces may involve different subregions in a network at different times, potentially reflecting functionally relevant relationships that are not captured with conventional data analysis. To investigate this, we examined publicly available functional magnetic resonance imaging data with a dedicated analysis method and found indications that functional networks inferred from conventional correlation analysis may indeed be driven by activity at only a few critical time points. Subsequent analysis of the activity at these critical time points revealed multiple spatial patterns, each distinctly different from the established functional networks. The spatial distribution of these patterns suggests a potential functional relevance.},

Despite a large body of literature documenting abnormal brain structure in 22q11DS, cerebral changes associated with brain maturation in 22q11DS remained largely unexplored. To map cortical maturation from childhood to adulthood in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, we used cerebral MRI from 59 patients with 22q11DS, aged 6 to 40, and 80 typically developing controls; three year follow-up assessments were also available for 32 patients and 31 matched controls. Cross-sectional cortical thickness trajectories during childhood and adolescence were approximated in age bins. Repeated-measures were also conducted with the longitudinal data. Within the group of patients with 22q11DS, exploratory measures of cortical thickness differences related to COMT polymorphism, IQ, and schizophrenia were also conducted. We observed deviant trajectories of cortical thickness changes with age in patients with 22q11DS. In affected preadolescents, larger prefrontal thickness was observed compared to age-matched controls. Afterward, we observed greater cortical loss in 22q11DS with a convergence of cortical thickness values by the end of adolescence. No compelling evidence for an effect of COMT polymorphism on cortical maturation was observed. Within 22q11DS, significant differences in cortical thickness were related to cognitive level in children and adolescents, and to schizophrenia in adults. Deviant trajectories of cortical thickness from childhood to adulthood provide strong in vivo cues for a defect in the programmed synaptic elimination, which in turn may explain the susceptibility of patients with 22q11DS to develop psychosis.},

@article{Mutlu2013,
abstract = {Abstract While significant differences in male and female brain structures have commonly been reported, only a few studies have focused on the sex differences in the way the cortex matures over time. Here, we investigated cortical thickness maturation between the age of 6 to 30 years, using 209 longitudinally-acquired brain {\{}MRI{\}} scans. Significant sex differences in the trajectories of cortical thickness change with age were evidenced using non-linear mixed effects models. Similar statistical analyses were computed to quantify the differences between cortical gyrification changes with age in males and females. During adolescence, we observed a statistically significant higher rate of cortical thinning in females compared to males in the right temporal regions, the left temporoparietal junction and the left orbitofrontal cortex. This finding is interpreted as a faster maturation of the social brain areas in females. Concomitantly, statistically significant sex differences in cortical folding changes with age were observed only in one cluster of the right prefrontal regions, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying cortical thickness and gyrification changes with age are quite distinct. Sexual dimorphism in the developmental course of the cortical maturation may be associated with the different age of onset and clinical presentation of many psychiatric disorders between males and females.},

The most common applications were two-level models where individuals were nested within contexts. Most studies were nonexperimental and used nonprobability samples. The amount of data at each level varied widely across studies, as did the number of models examined. Analyses of reporting practices indicated some clear problems, with many articles not reporting enough information for a reader to critique the reported analyses. For example, in many articles, one could not determine how many models were estimated, what covariance structure was assumed, what type of centering if any was used, whether the data were consistent with assumptions, whether outliers were present, or how the models were estimated. Guidelines for researchers reporting multilevel analyses are provided.},

abstract = {Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) has been in the focus of intensive research over the last 15 years. The syndrome represents a homogeneous model for studying the effect of a decreased dosage of genes on the development of brain structure and function and, consequently, on the emergence of schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder. In this review, we describe the psychiatric phenotype of children, adolescents, and young adults with VCFS. We redefine the concept of "behavioral phenotype" and suggest that psychosis fulfills the criteria of a behavioral phenotype of the syndrome. Identifying the risk factors for the emergence of psychosis in VCFS is a major goal of several large-scale longitudinal studies that are currently underway. We review the knowledge gained so far about risk factors for psychosis in VCFS, including early neuropsychiatric symptoms, development of brain structure and function, and the effect of a reduced dosage of genes from the 22q11 deletion region. Although the brain structure in subjects with VCFS is not drastically different from typically developing controls, newer imaging modalities that measure white matter tracts, cortical thickness, and cortical gyrification are likely to identify more subtle and specific neuroanatomical substrates of the syndrome. Among the 24 genes within the deletion region, the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on the VCFS phenotype has been investigated in depth. The findings suggest that because of haploinsufficiency of the COMT gene individuals with VCFS are exposed to a high level of prefrontal dopamine, and this interferes with their prefrontal cognitive functioning and may contribute to their high rate of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders. The other genes and environmental factors that shape the unique neuropsychiatric phenotype of VCFS are yet to be discovered.},

abstract = {The default-mode network (DMN) is a set of specific brain regions whose activity, predominant in the resting-state, is attenuated during cognitively demanding, externally-cued tasks. The cognitive correlates of this network have proven difficult to interrogate, but one hypothesis is that regions in the network process episodic memories and semantic knowledge integral to internally-generated mental activity. Here, we compare default-mode functional connectivity in the same group of subjects during rest and conscious sedation with midazolam, a state characterized by anterograde amnesia and a reduced level of consciousness. Although the DMN showed functional connectivity during both rest and conscious sedation, a direct comparison found that there was significantly reduced functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex during conscious sedation. These results confirm that low-frequency oscillations in the DMN persist and remain highly correlated even at reduced levels of consciousness. We hypothesize that focal reductions in DMN connectivity, as shown here in the posterior cingulate cortex, may represent a stable correlate of reduced consciousness. Keywords},

abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3{\%}. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

abstract = {In recent years, the brain's "default network," a set of regions characterized by decreased neural activity during goal-oriented tasks, has generated a significant amount of interest, as well as controversy. Much of the discussion has focused on the relationship of these regions to a "default mode" of brain function. In early studies, investigators suggested that, the brain's default mode supports "self-referential" or "introspective" mental activity. Subsequently, regions of the default network have been more specifically related to the "internal narrative," the "autobiographical self," "stimulus independent thought," "mentalizing," and most recently "self-projection." However, the extant literature on the function of the default network is limited to adults, i.e., after the system has reached maturity. We hypothesized that further insight into the network's functioning could be achieved by characterizing its development. In the current study, we used resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to characterize the development of the brain's default network. We found that the default regions are only sparsely functionally connected at early school age (7-9 years old); over development, these regions integrate into a cohesive, interconnected network.},

abstract = {The human brain is a complex system able to continuously adapt. Howand where brain activity is mod- ulated by behavior can be studiedwith functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive neuroimaging techniquewith excellent spatial resolution and whole-brain coverage. FMRI scans of healthy adults completing a variety of behavioral tasks have greatly contributed to our understanding of the functional role of individual brain regions. However, by statistically analyzing each region indepen- dently, these studies ignore that brain regions act in concert rather than in unison. Thus, many studies since have instead examined howbrain regions interact. Surprisingly, structured interactions between distinct brain regions not only occur during behavioral tasks but alsowhile a subject rests quietly in theMRI scanner. Multiple groups of regions interact very strongly with each other and not only do these groups bear a striking resemblance to the sets of regions co-activated in tasks, but many of these interactions are also progressively disrupted in neurological diseases. This suggests that spontaneous fluctuations in activity can provide novel insights into fundamental organizing principles of the human brain in health and disease.Many techniques to date have segregated regions into spatially distinct networks,which ignores that any brain region can take part in multiple networks across time. Amore natural view is to estimate dynamic brain networks that allowflexible functional interactions (or con- nectivity) over time. The estimation and analysis of such dynamic functional interactions is the subject of this dissertation.We take the perspective that dynamic brain networks evolve in a low-dimensional space and can be described by a small number of characteristic spatiotemporal patterns. Our proposed approaches are based onwell-established statistical methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), sparsematrix decompositions, temporal clustering, as well as a multiscale analysis by novel graphwavelet designs. We adapt and extend these methods to the analysis of dynamic brain networks. We show that PCA and its higher-order equivalent can identify co-varying functional interactions, which reveal disturbed dynamic properties inmultiple sclerosis andwhich are related to the timing of stimuli for task studies, respectively. Furtherwe showthat sparse matrix decompositions provide a valid alternative approach to PCA and improve interpretability of the identified patterns. Finally, assuming an even simpler low-dimensional space and the exclusive temporal expression of individual patterns,we showthat specific transient interactions of themedial prefrontal cortex are disturbed in aging and relate to impaired memory.},

They are widely used by various fields of social sciences, medical and biological sciences. However, the complex nature of these models has made variable selection and parameter estimation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a simple iterative procedure that estimates and selects fixed and random effects for linear mixed models. In particular, we propose to utilize the partial consistency property of the random effect coefficients and select groups of random effects simultaneously via a data-oriented penalty function (the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty function). We show that the proposed method is a consistent variable selection procedure and possesses some oracle properties. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are also conducted to empirically examine the performance of this procedure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The registration of images is a task that is at the core of many applications in computer vision. In computational neuroimaging where the automated segmentation of brain structures is frequently used to quantify change, a highly accurate registration is necessary for motion correction of images taken in the same session, or across time in longitudinal studies where changes in the images can be expected. This paper, inspired by Nestares and Heeger (2000), presents a method based on robust statistics to register images in the presence of differences, such as jaw movement, differential MR distortions and true anatomical change. The approach we present guarantees inverse consistency (symmetry), can deal with different intensity scales and automatically estimates a sensitivity parameter to detect outlier regions in the images. The resulting registrations are highly accurate due to their ability to ignore outlier regions and show superior robustness with respect to noise, to intensity scaling and outliers when compared to state-of-the-art registration tools such as FLIRT (in FSL) or the coregistration tool in SPM. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

A voxel-based network measure, degree, was used to assess age-related differences in tissue connectivity throughout the brain. Increases in connectivity with age were found in paralimbic cortical and subcortical regions. Decreases in connectivity were found in cortical regions, including visual areas and the default mode network. These findings differ from those of recent developmental studies examining earlier growth trajectories, and are consistent with known changes in cognitive function and emotional processing during mature aging. The results support and extend previous findings that relied on a priori definitions of regions of interest for their analyses. This approach of applying a voxel-based measure to examine the functional connectivity of individual tissue elements over time, without the need for a priori region of interest definitions, provides an important new tool in brain science.},

abstract = {Here, we demonstrate that subject motion produces substantial changes in the timecourses of resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates from the data. These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Longitudinal studies are useful for the characterization of developmental trajectories (ie, changes in imaging measures by age). Developmental trajectories (as opposed to static measures) have proven to have greater power in discriminating healthy from clinical groups and in predicting cognitive/behavioral measures, such as IQ. Here we summarize results from an ongoing longitudinal pediatric neuroimaging study that has been conducted at the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health since 1989. Developmental trajectories of structural MRI brain measures from healthy youth are compared and contrasted with trajectories in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and childhood-onset schizophrenia. Across ages 5–25 years, in both healthy and clinical populations, white matter volumes increase and gray matter volumes follow an inverted U trajectory, with peak size occurring at different times in different regions. At a group level, differences related to psychopathology are seen for gray and white matter volumes, rates of change, and for interconnectedness among disparate brain regions.},

We investigated the modular structure of these networks and tested the hypothesis that normal brain aging might be associated with changes in modularity of sparse networks. Newman's modularity metric was maximised and topological roles were assigned to brain regions depending on their specific contributions to intra- and inter-modular connectivity. Both young and older brain networks demonstrated significantly non-random modularity. The young brain network was decomposed into 3 major modules: central and posterior modules, which comprised mainly nodes with few inter-modular connections, and a dorsal fronto-cingulo-parietal module, which comprised mainly nodes with extensive inter-modular connections. The mean network in the older group also included posterior, superior central and dorsal fronto-striato-thalamic modules but the number of intermodular connections to frontal modular regions was significantly reduced, whereas the number of connector nodes in posterior and central modules was increased.},

abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Multi-site neuroimaging studies offer an efficient means to study brain functioning in large samples of individuals with rare conditions; however, they present new challenges given that aggregating data across sites introduces additional variability into measures of interest. Assessing the reliability of brain activation across study sites and comparing statistical methods for pooling functional data are critical to ensuring the validity of aggregating data across sites. The current study used two samples of healthy individuals to assess the feasibility and reliability of aggregating multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a Sternberg-style verbal working memory task. Participants were recruited as part of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS), which comprises eight fMRI scanning sites across the United States and Canada. In the first study sample (n= 8), one participant from each home site traveled to each of the sites and was scanned while completing the task on two consecutive days. Reliability was examined using generalizability theory. Results indicated that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was reproducible across sites and was highly reliable, or generalizable, across scanning sites and testing days for core working memory ROIs (generalizability ICCs. = 0.81 for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 0.95 for left superior parietal cortex). In the second study sample (n= 154), two statistical methods for aggregating fMRI data across sites for all healthy individuals recruited as control participants in the NAPLS study were compared. Control participants were scanned on one occasion at the site from which they were recruited. Results from the image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) method and mixed effects model with site covariance method both showed robust activation in expected regions (i.e. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, superior parietal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, basal ganglia). Quantification of the similarity of group maps from these methods confirmed a very high (96{\%}) degree of spatial overlap in results. Thus, brain activation during working memory function was reliable across the NAPLS sites and both the IBMA and mixed effects model with site covariance methods appear to be valid approaches for aggregating data across sites. These findings indicate that multi-site functional neuroimaging can offer a reliable means to increase power and generalizability of results when investigating brain function in rare populations and support the multi-site investigation of working memory function in the NAPLS study, in particular. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recently, functional connectivity analyses using spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations have been applied in the context of neurological and psychiatry diseases. In the analyses procedure, preprocessing steps are commonly utilized in exploring functional connectivity, the same strategy as what was conducted in the fMRI process. However, the effectiveness of these preprocessing steps on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was rarely investigated, and the significance of preprocessing steps on rs-fMRI needs to be studied. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of multiple preprocessing procedures, including slice-timing correction, smoothing, and spatial normalization, on rs-fMRI signal. Through a seed-based correlation analysis on the motor network, we empirically estimated three indices of spontaneous fMRI fluctuations induced: correlation coefficients (CC), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), and fractional ALFF (fALFF), with different strategies of three preprocessing steps. Multiple repetition times (TRs = 2, 3, 4 sec) were also compared to address the issue of temporal mismatch. In the temporal preprocess, we found that the use of slice-timing correction and different TRs had minimal effects on CC and fALFF. However, ALFF was significantly affected using different TR but not affected by slice-timing correction as well. In the spatial preprocess, fALFF was insensitive to both smoothing and normalization. Smoothing consistently increased spatial extents and CC, but suppressed ALFF values. Performing normalization before index calculations provided better spatial sensitivity with larger variability in ALFF, whereas performing normalization after index calculations might preserve the ALFF level as in the unnormalized data. Conclusively, the effects of choosing preprocessing parameters and strategies were presented in the current study, providing practical considerations when conducting rs-fMRI analyses.},

abstract = {Altered topological properties of brain connectivity networks have emerged as important features of schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate how the state-related modulations to graph measures of functional integration and functional segregation brain networks are disrupted in schizophrenia. Firstly, resting state and auditory oddball discrimination (AOD) fMRI data of healthy controls (HCs) and schizophrenia patients (SZs) were decomposed into spatially independent components (ICs) by group independent component analysis (ICA). Then, weighted positive and negative functional integration (inter-component networks) and functional segregation (intra-component networks) brain networks were built in each subject. Subsequently, connectivity strength, clustering coefficient, and global efficiency of all brain networks were statistically compared between groups (HCs and SZs) in each state and between states (rest and AOD) within group. We found that graph measures of negative functional integration brain network and several positive functional segregation brain networks were altered in schizophrenia during AOD task. The metrics of positive functional integration brain network and one positive functional segregation brain network were higher during the resting state than during the AOD task only in HCs. These findings imply that state-related characteristics of both functional integration and functional segregation brain networks are impaired in schizophrenia which provides new insight into the altered brain performance in this brain disorder.},

abstract = {As the aging population grows, it has become increasingly important to carefully characterize amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for monitoring disease progression in selectively vulnerable brain regions associated with AD neuropathology. However, the reliability of fMRI data in longitudinal studies of older adults with aMCI is largely unexplored. To address this, aMCI participants completed two visual working tasks, a Delayed-Recognition task and a One-Back task, on three separate scanning sessions over a three-month period. Test-retest reliability of the fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity was assessed using an intraclass correlation (ICC) analysis approach. Results indicated that brain regions engaged during the task displayed greater reliability across sessions compared to regions that were not utilized by the task. During task-engagement, differential reliability scores were observed across the brain such that the frontal lobe, medial temporal lobe, and subcortical structures exhibited fair to moderate reliability (ICC. =. 0.3-0.6), while temporal, parietal, and occipital regions exhibited moderate to good reliability (ICC. =. 0.4-0.7). Additionally, reliability across brain regions was more stable when three fMRI sessions were used in the ICC calculation relative to two fMRI sessions. In conclusion, the fMRI BOLD signal is reliable across scanning sessions in this population and thus a useful tool for tracking longitudinal change in observational and interventional studies in aMCI.?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({\textgreater} 0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks - two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions - a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Conventional group analysis is usually performed with Student-type t-test, regression, or standard AN(C)OVA in which the variance-covariance matrix is presumed to have a simple structure. Some correction approaches are adopted when assumptions about the covariance structure is violated. However, as experiments are designed with different degrees of sophistication, these traditional methods can become cumbersome, or even be unable to handle the situation at hand. For example, most current FMRI software packages have difficulty analyzing the following scenarios at group level: (1) taking within-subject variability into account when there are effect estimates from multiple runs or sessions; (2) continuous explanatory variables (covariates) modeling in the presence of a within-subject (repeated measures) factor, multiple subject-grouping (between-subjects) factors, or the mixture of both; (3) subject-specific adjustments in covariate modeling; (4) group analysis with estimation of hemodynamic response (HDR) function by multiple basis functions; (5) various cases of missing data in longitudinal studies; and (6) group studies involving family members or twins.Here we present a linear mixed-effects modeling (LME) methodology that extends the conventional group analysis approach to analyze many complicated cases, including the six prototypes delineated above, whose analyses would be otherwise either difficult or unfeasible under traditional frameworks such as AN(C)OVA and general linear model (GLM). In addition, the strength of the LME framework lies in its flexibility to model and estimate the variance-covariance structures for both random effects and residuals. The intraclass correlation (ICC) values can be easily obtained with an LME model with crossed random effects, even at the presence of confounding fixed effects. The simulations of one prototypical scenario indicate that the LME modeling keeps a balance between the control for false positives and the sensitivity for activation detection. The importance of hypothesis formulation is also illustrated in the simulations. Comparisons with alternative group analysis approaches and the limitations of LME are discussed in details. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Recent advances in brain connectivity methods have made it possible to identify hubs-the brain's most globally connected regions. Such regions are essential for coordinating brain functions due to their connectivity with numerous regions with a variety of specializations. Current structural and functional connectivity methods generally agree that default mode network (DMN) regions have among the highest global brain connectivity (GBC). We developed two novel statistical approaches using resting state functional connectivity MRI-weighted and unweighted GBC (wGBC and uGBC)-to test the hypothesis that the highest global connectivity also occurs in the cognitive control network (CCN), a network anti-correlated with the DMN across a variety of tasks. High global connectivity was found in both CCN and DMN. The newly developed wGBC approach improves upon existing methods by quantifying inter-subject consistency, quantifying the highest GBC values by percentage, and avoiding arbitrarily connection strength thresholding. The uGBC approach is based on graph theory and includes many of these improvements, but still requires an arbitrary connection threshold. We found high GBC in several subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus, basal ganglia) only with wGBC despite the regions' extensive anatomical connectivity. These results demonstrate the complementary utility of wGBC and uGBC analyses for the characterization of the most highly connected, and thus most functionally important, regions of the brain. Additionally, the high connectivity of both the CCN and the DMN demonstrates that brain regions outside primary sensory-motor networks are highly involved in coordinating information throughout the brain. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have found that functional changes exist in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in patients with PD are task-related and cross-sectional. This study investigated the functional changes observed in patients with PD, at both baseline and after 2 years, using resting-state fMRI. It further investigated the relationship between whole-brain spontaneous neural activity of patients with PD and their clinical characteristics. METHODS: Seventeen patients with PD underwent an MRI procedure at both baseline and after 2 years using resting-state fMRI that was derived from the same 3T MRI. In addition, 20 age- and sex-matched, healthy controls were examined using resting-state fMRI. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) approach was used to analyze the fMRI data. Nonlinear registration was used to model within-subject changes over the scanning interval, as well as changes between the patients with PD and the healthy controls. A correlative analysis between the fALFF values and clinical characteristics was performed in the regions showing fALFF differences. RESULTS: Compared to the control subjects, the patients with PD showed increased fALFF values in the left inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and right middle frontal gyrus. Compared to the baseline in the 2 years follow-up, the patients with PD presented with increased fALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus and right middle occipital gyrus while also having decreased fALFF values in the right cerebellum, right thalamus, right striatum, left superior parietal lobule, left IPL, left precentral gyrus, and left postcentral gyrus (P {\textless} 0.01, after correction with AlphaSim). In addition, the fALFF values in the right cerebellum were positively correlated with the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores (r = 0.51, P {\textless} 0.05, uncorrected) and the change in the UPDRS motor score (r = 0.61, P {\textless} 0.05, uncorrected). CONCLUSIONS: The baseline and longitudinal changes of the fALFF values in our study suggest that dysfunction in the brain may affect the regions related to cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loops and cerebello-thalamo-cortical loops as the disease progresses and that alterations to the spontaneous neural activity of the cerebellum may also play an important role in the disease's progression in patients with PD.},

Cross-sectional studies completely confound within- and between-subject sources of variation and hence rely on the presence of parallel trajectories and negligible sampling and age cohort differences for making valid developmental inferences. Delineating trajectories of within-individual change over substantial periods of time requires data covering long age spans that often cannot be covered using single-cohort longitudinal designs. Unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs are a commonly used alternative that can cover a longer age span in a shorter interval than necessary for a single-cohort design. However, the impact of cohort and sampling effects is often minimized or ignored in unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. The authors propose that structured multicohort longitudinal designs are a particularly viable and underutilized class of designs in psychiatry that represents a significant improvement over cross-sectional designs and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs for making developmental inferences while being more practical to implement than single-cohort longitudinal designs. As an example of this approach, the authors analyze changes in entorhinal cortex thickness in Alzheimer's disease in relation to APOE-epsilon4 genotype},

abstract = {The involvement of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) has been noticed. TMD patients have been shown dysfunction of motor performance and reduced cognitive ability in neuropsychological tests. The aim of this study is to explore the spontaneous neural activity in TMD patients with centric relation (CR)-maximum intercuspation (MI) discrepancy before and after stabilization splint treatment. Twenty-three patients and twenty controls underwent clinical evaluations, including CR-MI discrepancy, Helkimo indices and chronic pain, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. Eleven patients repeated the evaluations and scanning after the initial wearing (T1) and 3months of wearing (T2) of the stabilization splint. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was calculated to compare the neural functions. At baseline, the patients showed decreased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, middle frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex compared with the controls (P{\textless}0.05, AlphaSim corrected). Negative correlations were found between the fALFF in the left precentral gyrus and vertical CR-MI discrepancy of bilateral temporomandibular joints of patients (P{\textless}0.05, two-tailed). At T2, the symptoms and signs of the patients were improved, and a stable condylar position on the CR was recovered, with increased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus and left posterior insula compared with pretreatment. The fALFF decrease in the patients before treatment was no longer evident at T2 compared with the controls. The results suggested that TMD patients with CR-MI discrepancy showed significantly decreased brain activity in their frontal cortexes. The stabilization splint elicited functional recovery in these cortical areas. These findings provided insight into the cortical neuroplastic processes underlying TMD with CR-MI discrepancy and the therapeutic mechanisms of stabilization splint.},

abstract = {The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a widely recognized genetic model allowing the study of neuroanatomical biomarkers that underlie the risk for developing schizophrenia. Recent advances in magnetic resonance image analyses enable the examination of structural connectivity integrity, scarcely used in the 22q11DS field. This framework potentially provides evidence for the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia in this high-risk population. In the present study, we quantify the whole brain white matter connections in 22q11DS using deterministic tractography. Diffusion Tensor Imaging was acquired in 30 affected patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy participants. The Human Connectome technique was applied to register white matter streamlines with cortical anatomy. The number of fibers (streamlines) was used as a measure of connectivity for comparison between groups at the global, lobar and regional level. All statistics were corrected for age and gender. Results showed a 10{\%} reduction of the total number of fibers in patients compared to controls. After correcting for this global reduction, preserved connectivity was found within the right frontal and right parietal lobes. The relative increase in the number of fibers was located mainly in the right hemisphere. Conversely, an excessive reduction of connectivity was observed within and between limbic structures. Finally, a disproportionate reduction was shown at the level of fibers connecting the left fronto-temporal regions. We could therefore speculate that the observed disruption to fronto-temporal connectivity in individuals at risk of schizophrenia implies that fronto-temporal disconnectivity, frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, could precede the onset of symptoms and, as such, constitutes a biomarker of the vulnerability to develop psychosis. On the contrary, connectivity alterations in the limbic lobe play a role in a wide range of psychiatric disorders and therefore seem to be less specific in defining schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The clinical picture associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) includes mild mental retardation and an increased risk of schizophrenia. While the clinical phenotype has been related to structural brain network alterations, there is only scarce information about functional connectivity in 22q11DS. However, such studies could lead to a better comprehension of the disease and reveal potential biomarkers for psychosis. A connectivity decoding approach was used to discriminate between 42 patients with 22q11DS and 41 controls using resting-state connectivity. The same method was then applied within the 22q11DS group to identify brain connectivity patterns specifically related to the presence of psychotic symptoms. An accuracy of 84 {\%} was achieved in differentiating patients with 22q11DS from controls. The discriminative connections were widespread, but predominantly located in the bilateral frontal and right temporal lobes, and were significantly correlated to IQ. An 88 {\%} accuracy was obtained for identification of existing psychotic symptoms within the patients group. The regions containing most discriminative connections included the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the left superior temporal and the right inferior frontal gyri. Functional connectivity alterations in 22q11DS affect mostly frontal and right temporal lobes and are related to the syndrome's mild mental retardation. These results also provide evidence that resting-state connectivity can potentially become a biomarker for psychosis and that ACC plays an important role in the development of psychotic symptoms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The neural endophenotype associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) includes deviant cortical development and alterations in brain connectivity. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings also reported disconnectivity within the default mode network (DMN). In this study, we explored the relationship between functional and structural DMN connectivity and their changes with age in patients with 22q11DS in comparison to control participants. Given previous evidence of an association between DMN disconnectivity and the manifestation of psychotic symptoms, we further investigated this relationship in our group of patients with 22q11DS. METHODS: T1-weighted, diffusion, and resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 41 patients with 22q11DS and 43 control participants aged 6 to 28 years. A data-driven approach based on independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify the DMN and to define regions of interest for the structural and functional connectivity analysis. Prodromal psychotic symptoms were assessed in adolescents and adults using the positive symptom scores of the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS). Connectivity measures were compared between groups and correlated with age. Repeating the between-group analysis in three different age bins further assessed the presence of age-related alterations in DMN connectivity. Structural and functional connectivity measures were then correlated with the SIPS scores. RESULTS: A simultaneous reduction of functional and structural connectivity between core medial nodes of the DMN was observed. Furthermore, structural connectivity measures significantly increased with age in the control group but not in patients with 22q11DS, suggesting the presence of an age-related alteration of the DMN structural connections. No correlations were found between the DMN disconnectivity and expression of prodromal symptoms in 22q11DS. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the presence of functional and structural DMN disconnectivity in 22q11DS and that patients with 22q11DS fail to develop normal structural connections between medial DMN nodes. This suggests the presence of altered neurodevelopmental trajectories in 22q11DS.},

In this study, we applied a three-dimensional method for quantifying gyrification at thousands of points over the cortical surface to imaging data from 44 children, adolescents, and young adults with 22q11.2DS (17 males, 27 females; mean age 17y 2mo [SD 9y 1mo], range 6-37y), and 53 healthy participants (21 males, 32 females; mean age 15y 4mo [SD 8y 6mo]; range 6-40y). Several clusters of reduced gyrification were observed, further substantiating the pattern of cerebral alterations presented by children with the syndrome. Comparisons within 22q11.2DS demonstrated an effect of congenital heart disease (CHD) on cortical gyrification, with reduced gyrification at the parieto-temporo-occipital junction in patients with CHD, as compared with patients without CHD. Reductions in gyrification can resemble mild polymicrogyria, suggesting early abnormal neuronal proliferation or migration and providing support for an effect of hemodynamic factors on brain development in 22q11.2DS. The results also shed light on the pathophysiology of acquired brain injury in other populations with CHD.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is increasingly recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder with altered connectivity among brain networks. In the current study we examined large-scale network interactions in childhood-onset schizophrenia, a severe form of the disease with salient genetic and neurobiological abnormalities. Using a data-driven analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fluctuations, we characterized data from 19 patients with schizophrenia and 26 typically developing controls, group matched for age, sex, handedness, and magnitude of head motion during scanning. This approach identified 26 regions with decreased functional correlations in schizophrenia compared to controls. These regions were found to organize into two function-related networks, the first with regions associated with social and higher-level cognitive processing, and the second with regions involved in somatosensory and motor processing. Analyses of across- and within-network regional interactions revealed pronounced across-network decreases in functional connectivity in the schizophrenia group, as well as a set of across-network relationships with overall negative coupling indicating competitive or opponent network dynamics. Critically, across-network decreases in functional connectivity in schizophrenia predicted the severity of positive symptoms in the disorder, such as hallucinations and delusions. By contrast, decreases in functional connectivity within the social-cognitive network of regions predicted the severity of negative symptoms, such as impoverished speech and flattened affect. These results point toward the role that abnormal integration of sensorimotor and social-cognitive processing may play in the pathophysiology and symptomatology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Children who are adept at any one of the three academic 'R's (reading, writing and arithmetic) tend to be good at the others, and grow into adults who are similarly skilled at diverse intellectually demanding activities. Determining the neuroanatomical correlates of this relatively stable individual trait of general intelligence has proved difficult, particularly in the rapidly developing brains of children and adolescents. Here we demonstrate that the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, rather than cortical thickness itself, is most closely related to level of intelligence. Using a longitudinal design, we find a marked developmental shift from a predominantly negative correlation between intelligence and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond. Additionally, level of intelligence is associated with the trajectory of cortical development, primarily in frontal regions implicated in the maturation of intelligent activity.

abstract = {There is controversy over the nature of the disturbance in brain development that underpins attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In particular, it is unclear whether the disorder results from a delay in brain maturation or whether it represents a complete deviation from the template of typical development. Using computational neuroanatomic techniques, we estimated cortical thickness at {\textgreater}40,000 cerebral points from 824 magnetic resonance scans acquired prospectively on 223 children with ADHD and 223 typically developing controls. With this sample size, we could define the growth trajectory of each cortical point, delineating a phase of childhood increase followed by adolescent decrease in cortical thickness (a quadratic growth model). From these trajectories, the age of attaining peak cortical thickness was derived and used as an index of cortical maturation. We found maturation to progress in a similar manner regionally in both children with and without ADHD, with primary sensory areas attaining peak cortical thickness before polymodal, high-order association areas. However, there was a marked delay in ADHD in attaining peak thickness throughout most of the cerebrum: the median age by which 50{\%} of the cortical points attained peak thickness for this group was 10.5 years (SE 0.01), which was significantly later than the median age of 7.5 years (SE 0.02) for typically developing controls (log rank test chi(1)(2) = 5,609, P {\textless} 1.0 x 10(-20)). The delay was most prominent in prefrontal regions important for control of cognitive processes including attention and motor planning. Neuroanatomic documentation of a delay in regional cortical maturation in ADHD has not been previously reported.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) modifies atrial fibrillation (AF) by eliminating drivers or atrial debulking remains unknown. This randomized study aimed to determine the effect of ablating different CFAE morphologies compared with normal electrograms (ie, debulking normal tissue) on the cycle length of persistent AF (AFCL). METHODS AND RESULTS: After pulmonary vein isolation left and right atrial CFAE were targeted, until termination of AF or abolition of CFAE before DC cardioversion. Ten-second electrograms were classified according to a validated scale, with grade 1 being most fractionated and grade 5 normal. Patients were randomly assigned to have CFAE grades eliminated sequentially, from grade 1 to 5 (group 1) or grade 5 to 1 (group 2). An increase in AFCL (mean of left and right atrial appendage) ≥5 ms after a lesion was regarded as significant. CFAE (n=968) were targeted in 20 patients. AFCL increased after targeting 51±35{\%} of grade 1 CFAE, 30±15{\%} grade 2, 12±5{\%} grade 3, 33±12{\%} grade 4, and 8±15{\%} grade 5 CFAE (P{\textless}0.01 for grades 1, 2, and 4 versus 5; 3 versus 5, not significant). The proportion of lesions causing AFCL prolongation was unaffected by the order in which CFAE were targeted. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting CFAE is not simply atrial debulking. Ablating certain grades of CFAE increases AFCL, suggesting they are more important in maintaining AF. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate propagation patterns in intracardiac signals recorded during atrial fibrillation (AF) using an approach based on partial directed coherence (PDC), which evaluates directional coupling between multiple signals in the frequency domain. The PDC is evaluated at the dominant frequency of AF signals and tested for significance using a surrogate data procedure specifically designed to assess causality. For significantly coupled sites, the approach allows also to estimate the delay in propagation. The methods potential is illustrated with two simulation scenarios based on a detailed ionic model of the human atrial myocyte as well as with real data recordings, selected to present typical propagation mechanisms and recording situations in atrial tachyarrhythmias. In both simulation scenarios the significant PDCs correctly reflect the direction of coupling and thus the propagation between all recording sites. In the real data recordings, clear propagation patterns are identified which agree with previous clinical observations. Thus, the results illustrate the ability of the novel approach to identify propagation patterns from intracardiac signals during AF, which can provide important information about the underlying AF mechanisms, potentially improving the planning and outcome of arrhythmia ablation.},

abstract = {We introduce a new hypothesis testing framework, based on surrogate data generation, to assess in the frequency domain the concept of causality among multivariate (MV) time series. The approach extends the traditional Fourier Transform (FT) method for generating surrogate data in a MV process and adapts it to the specific issue of causality. It generates causal FT (CFT) surrogates with FT modulus taken from the original series, and FT phase taken from a set of series with causal interactions set to zero over the direction of interest and preserved over all other directions. Two different zero-setting procedures, acting on the parameters of a MV autoregressive (MVAR) model fitted on the original series, were used respectively to test the null hypotheses of absence of direct causal influence (CFTd surrogates) and of full (direct and indirect) causal influence (CFTf surrogates). CFTf and CFTd surrogates were utilized respectively in combination with the directed coherence (DC) and the partial DC (PDC) spectral causality estimators. Simulations reproducing different causality patterns in linear MVAR processes demonstrated the better accuracy of CFTf and CFTd surrogates with respect to traditional FT surrogates. Application on real MV biological data measured from healthy humans, i.e. heart period, arterial pressure and respiration variability, as well as multichannel EEG signals, showed that CFT surrogates disclose causal patterns in accordance with expected cardiorespiratory and neurophysiological mechanisms.},

If the value computed for the original data is significantly different than the ensemble of values computed for the surrogate data, then the null hypothesis is rejected and nonlinearity is detected. We discuss various null hypotheses and discriminating statistics. The method is demonstrated for numerical data generated by known chaotic systems, and applied to a number of experimental time series which arise in the measurement of superfluids, brain waves, and sunspots; we evaluate the statistical significance of the evidence for nonlinear structure in each case, and illustrate aspects of the data which this approach identifies.},

The significance of spatial (loop morphology) parameters is studied in relation to AF frequency, hypothesizing that more organized AF, being expressed by lower frequency, is associated with decreased variability in loop morphology. The results showed that loop orientation can be determined from global analysis (i.e., the entire 60-s segment is used) or the mean of segment-based analysis, both types of analysis leading to similar results. The hypothesis that more organized AF is associated with decreased variability in loop morphology was to some extent confirmed for the parameters planarity and planar geometry; for 1-s segments, the correlation to AF frequency was 0.608 (ples0.001) and 0.543 (ples0.005).},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relative contributions of different atrial regions to the maintenance of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) are not known. METHODS: Sixty patients (53 +/- 9 years) undergoing catheter ablation of persistent AF (17 +/- 27 months) were studied. Ablation was performed in a randomized sequence at different left atrial (LA) regions and comprised isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV), isolation of other thoracic veins, and atrial tissue ablation targeting all regions with rapid or heterogeneous activation or guided by activation mapping. Finally, linear ablation at the roof and mitral isthmus was performed if sinus rhythm was not restored after addressing the above-mentioned areas. The impact of ablation was evaluated by the effect on the fibrillatory cycle length in the coronary sinus and appendages at each step. Activation mapping and entrainment maneuvers were used to define the mechanisms and locations of intermediate focal or macroreentrant atrial tachycardias. RESULTS: AF terminated in 52 patients (87{\%}), directly to sinus rhythm in 7 or via the ablation of 1-6 intermediate atrial tachycardias (total 87) in 45 patients. This conversion was preceded by prolongation of fibrillatory cycle length by 39 +/- 9 msec, with the greatest magnitude occurring during ablation at the anterior LA, coronary sinus and PV-LA junction. Thirty-eight atrial tachycardias were focal (originating dominantly from these same sites), while 49 were macroreentrant (involving the mitral or cavotricuspid isthmus or LA roof). Patients without AF termination displayed shorter fibrillatory cycles at baseline: 130 +/- 14 vs 156 +/- 23 msec; P = 0.002. CONCLUSION: Termination of persistent AF can be achieved in 87{\%} of patients by catheter ablation. Ablation of the structures annexed to the left atrium-the left atrial appendage, coronary sinus, and PVs-have the greatest impact on the prolongation of AF cycle length, the conversion of AF to atrial tachycardia, and the termination of focal atrial tachycardias.},

abstract = {The efficacy of catheter-based ablation techniques to treat atrial fibrillation is limited not only by recurrences of this arrhythmia but also, and not less importantly, by new-onset organized atrial tachycardias. The incidence of such tachycardias depends on the type and duration of the baseline atrial fibrillation and specially on the ablation technique which was used during the index procedure. It has been repeatedly reported that the more extensive the left atrial surface ablated, the higher the incidence of organized atrial tachycardias. The exact origin of the pathologic substrate of these trachycardias is not fully understood and may result from the interaction between preexistent regions with abnormal electrical properties and the new ones resultant from radiofrequency delivery. From a clinical point of view these atrial tachycardias tend to remit after a variable time but in some cases are responsible for significant symptoms. A precise knowledge of the most frequent types of these arrhythmias, of their mechanisms and components is necessary for a thorough electrophysiologic characterization if a new ablation procedure is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia (AT) occurring following catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may be challenging to map and ablate because their mechanism and location is unpredictable and may be multiple in an individual patient. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort of 128 consecutive patients presenting 246 AT in the context of prior AF ablation was investigated. Using activation and entrainment mapping and applying the consensus definition of AT, we evaluated a deductive diagnostic approach based on up to three steps: (1) cycle length regularity, (2) search for macroreentry (i.e., involving {\textgreater}2 separate atrial segments), and (3) if macroreentry excluded, search for focal origin giving a centrifugal activation of the atria. A total of 238/246 (97{\%}) sustained AT (mean cycle length [CL] 284 +/- 87 ms) were successfully mapped (single AT, 51 pts; multiple AT, 77 pts) with a diagnostic time of 10 +/- 8 min per tachycardia. AT were macroreentrant in 109 (46{\%}) and focal in 129 (54{\%}). Of the latter, only 34 focal AT originated from a discrete point site fulfilling the consensus criteria, while a distinct mechanism, localized reentry (AT that was neither macro reentry nor focal), was identified in 95. Localized reentry was defined by (1) electrograms covering {\textgreater}or=75{\%} of the cycle length of AT within an area covering a single or 2 contiguous segments, (2) postpacing interval (PPI) {\textless} 30 ms at the site, (3) an identifiable zone of slow conduction, and (4) centrifugal activation of the atrium from the area. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrates the feasibility of rapid and accurate identification of all types of postablation AT in a large cohort of patients and describes the dominant role of localized reentry as a novel mechanism of AT.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the electroanatomic characteristics of left atrial tachycardia (AT) in a series of patients who underwent circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) and to describe the ablation strategy and clinical outcome. Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation. A potential midterm complication is the development of left AT. There are only isolated reports describing mapping and ablation of such arrhythmias. Thirteen patients (age 57.4 ± 8.9 years, five female) underwent mapping and ablation of 14 left ATs via an electroanatomic mapping system a mean of 2.6 ± 1.6 months after CPVA. Three patients were characterized as having focal AT (cycle length: 266 ± 35.9 ms). Of 11 macro-re-entrant tachycardias studied in the remaining 10 patients (cycle length: 275 ± 75 ms), 5 showed single-loop and 6 dual-loop circuits. Re-entrant circuits used the mitral isthmus, the posterior wall, or gaps on previous encircling lines. Such gaps and all three foci occurred anterior to the left superior pulmonary vein or at the septal aspect of the right pulmonary veins. Thirteen of 14 tachycardias (93{\%}) were successfully ablated. Left AT after CPVA can be due to a macro-re-entrant or focal mechanism. Re-entry occurs most commonly across the mitral isthmus, the posterior wall, or gaps on previous ablation lines. Such gaps and foci occur most commonly at the anterior aspect of the left superior pulmonary vein and at the septal aspect of the right pulmonary veins. These arrhythmias can be successfully mapped and ablated with an electroanatomic mapping system. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the incidence, electrophysiological properties, and ablation results for left atrial (LA) tachycardia as a sequel to the circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) for atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with AF underwent CPVA. Sustained LA tachycardia developed in 21/67 (31{\%}) patients and in 16/21 symptomatic patients 55 LA tachycardias (3.4+/-2.4 per patient) were mapped: 18 (33{\%}) tachycardias were related to macro-re-entry around the mitral valve (7) or pulmonary vein(s) (11). In 20 tachycardias (36{\%}), a 'small-loop' LA re-entrant tachycardia (LART) was identified; gaps in prior ablation lines (7 LART) or an area of extremely slow conduction adjacent to the CPVA lesions (13 LART) were crucial for these re-entries. Seventeen tachycardias (31{\%}) were too unstable for complete mapping. Ablation was a primary success in 34 of 38 (89{\%}) mapped LART, but in eight of 21 procedures, cardioversion was necessary to achieve sinus rhythm. CONCLUSION: LART develops in a high percentage of patients after CPVA. Small-loop re-entry, which is difficult to map, may arise and patients suffer from several and/or unstable variants of LART. Thus, mapping and ablation of these LART is challenging and the overall success is yet not satisfactory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) linear lesions are effective in substrate modification for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, achievement of complete conduction block remains challenging and conduction recovery is commonly observed. The aim of the study was to investigate the localization of gap sites of recovered LA linear lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with paroxysmal (n = 26) and persistent/permanent (n = 22) AF underwent repeat ablation after pulmonary vein (PV) isolation and LA linear ablation at the LA roof and/or mitral isthmus due to recurrences of AF or flutter. In 35 patients, conduction through the mitral isthmus line (ML) had recovered whereas roof-line recovery was observed in 30 patients. The gaps within the ML were distributed to the junction between left inferior PV and left atrial appendage in 66{\%}, the middle part of the ML in 20{\%}, and in 8{\%} to the endocardial aspect of the ML while only 6{\%} of lines showed an epicardial site of recovery. The RL predominantly recovered close to the right superior PV (54{\%}) and less frequently in the mid roof or close to the left PV (both 23{\%}). Reablation of lines required significantly shorter RF durations (ML: 7.24 +/- 5.55 minutes vs 24.08 +/- 9.38 minutes, RL: 4.24 +/- 2.34 minutes vs 11.54 +/- 6.49 minutes; P = 0.0001). Patients with persistent/permanent AF demonstrated a significantly longer conduction delay circumventing the complete lines than patients with paroxysmal AF (228 +/- 77 ms vs 164 +/- 36 ms, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in recovered LA lines were predominantly located close to the PVs where catheter stability is often difficult to achieve. Shorter RF durations are required for reablation of recovered linear lesions. Conduction times around complete LA lines are significantly longer in patients with persistent/permanent AF as compared to patients with paroxysmal AF.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Organized atrial arrhythmias following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation are typically due to recovered pulmonary vein (PV) conduction or reentry at incomplete ablation lines. We describe the role of nonablated anterior left atrium (LA) in arrhythmias observed after AF ablation. METHODS: A total of 275 consecutive patients with paroxysmal (n = 200) or chronic (n = 75) AF had PV isolation with/without additional linear ablation at the mitral isthmus (n = 106), LA roof (n = 23), or both (n = 88). Organized arrhythmias occurring after ablation were evaluated utilizing activation and entrainment mapping. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (11 female, 65 +/- 13 years, 10 chronic AF, 10 structural heart disease) demonstrated tachycardia localized to the anterior LA, an area not targeted by prior ablation. Eight had ECG features during sinus rhythm suggestive of impaired anterior LA conduction at baseline. These arrhythmias demonstrated a distinctive ECG flutter morphology in 7 of 10 (70{\%}) with discrete -/+ or +/-/+ aspect in inferior leads. Mapping the anterior LA revealed electrograms spanning the entire tachycardia cycle length (325 +/- 125 msec). Entrainment was possible in all with a postpacing interval exceeding the tachycardia cycle length by 9 +/- 10 msec. Electroanatomic mapping in 6 demonstrated small reentrant circuits rotating clockwise in 4 and counterclockwise in 2. Low-amplitude, fractionated mid-diastolic potentials with long duration (200 +/- 80 msec) occupying 63 +/- 22{\%} of the cycle length were targeted for ablation resulting in termination and subsequent noninducibility. CONCLUSION: Organized arrhythmias occurring after AF ablation can be due to reentrant circuits localized to the anterior LA, predominantly in females with chronic AF, structural heart disease, and abnormal atrial conduction. They are characterized by a distinctive surface ECG and highly responsive to RF ablation at the slow conduction area.},

Different from traditional batch-mode group lasso algorithms, which suffer from the inefficiency and poor scalability, our proposed algorithm performs in an online mode and scales well: at each iter- ation one can update the weight vector accord- ing to a closed-form solution based on the aver- age of previous subgradients. Therefore, the pro- posed online algorithm can be very efficient and scalable. This is guaranteed by its low worst-case time complexity and memory cost both in the or- der of O(d), where d is the number of dimen- sions. Moreover, in order to achieve more sparsity in both the group level and the individual feature level, we successively extend our online system to efficiently solve a number of variants of sparse group lasso models. We also show that the online system is applicable to other group lasso models, such as the group lasso with overlap and graph lasso. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our algorithm by experimenting with both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the common cardiac arrhythmia. It can be managed pharmacologically and is more and more frequently cured using ablation therapy. The success rates of radio-frequency ablation however are not satisfactory, and the majority of persistent AF patients need to undergo multiple interventions. Computational modeling of the atria bears the potential of providing deeper insights into the cellular and tissue mechanisms causing AF.This thesis targets three fields of multi-scale atrial modeling. First, advanced models of the cellular atrial electrophysiology and regional fiber orientation are introduced. Second, novel methods to create patient-specific anatomical and excitation propagation models of the atria are described. Third, potential applications of personalized models in basic research and clinical practice are presented.The advances described enable the generation of reliable personalized atrial models from medical image and electrical data. The results mark an important step towards the patient-specific model-based AF diagnosis, understanding and treatment.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and the most common indication for catheter ablation. However, despite substantial technical advances in mapping and energy delivery, ablation outcomes remain suboptimal. A major limitation to AF ablation is that the areas targeted for ablation are rarely of proven mechanistic importance, in sharp contrast to other arrhythmias in which ablation targets demonstrated mechanisms in each patient. Focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) is a new approach to demonstrate the mechanisms that sustain AF ("substrates") in each patient that can be used to guide ablation then confirm elimination of each mechanism. FIRM mapping reveals that AF is sustained by 2-3 rotors and focal sources, with a greater number in patients with persistent than paroxysmal AF, lying within spatially reproducible 2.2 ± 1.4-cm(2) areas in diverse locations. This temporospatial reproducibility, now confirmed by several groups using various methods, changes the concepts regarding AF-sustaining mechanisms, enabling localized rather than widespread ablation. Mechanistically, the role of rotors and focal sources in sustaining AF has been demonstrated by the acute and chronic success of source (FIRM) ablation alone. Clinically, adding FIRM to conventional ablation substantially improves arrhythmia freedom compared with conventional ablation alone, and ongoing randomized trials are comparing FIRM-ablation with and without conventional ablation to conventional ablation alone. In conclusion, ablation of patient-specific AF-sustaining mechanisms (substrates), as exemplified by FIRM, may be central to substantially improving AF ablation outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little information about the surface expression of non-cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent right atrial (RA) or left atrial (LA) flutter circuits. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 32 episodes (in 26 patients) of atypical RA and 22 episodes (in 21 patients) of LA flutter. The surface ECG of 13 patients with lower-loop reentry was similar to that of their pattern during counterclockwise (CCW) CTI atrial flutter (AFL), except for decreased amplitude of the terminal forces in the inferior leads. In 11 of 24 episodes characterized by high or multiple breaks over the crista, the ECG showed changes that depended on the initial activation sequence of the LA. In 7 of 8 episodes of upper-loop reentry, the ECG pattern completely mimicked that for clockwise (CW) CTI AFL. All 11 patients with an LA septal circuit showed a typical ECG pattern characterized by prominent forces in lead V1 with flat deflections in the other surface leads. Eleven patients with other LA circuits had a more variable pattern but showed decreased voltage in the inferior leads compared with that of a group with CCW-CTI AFL (1.6+/-1 vs 2.68+/-0.7 mV, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The RA surface-ECG patterns different from those of CCW or CW-CTI could still be CTI dependent. In contrast, a typical CW-CTI surface pattern was always seen in patients with upper-loop reentry, which was non-CTI dependent. LA AFL circuits had either flat or low-amplitude forces in the inferior leads.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We describe a new cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) circuit. METHODS: This study includes 8 patients referred for atrial flutter (AFL) ablation whose tachycardia circuit was confined to the septal CTI and the os of the coronary sinus (CS(OS)) region. Entrainment mapping was performed within the CTI, CS(OS), and other right atrial annular sites (tricuspid annulus (TA)). Electroanatomic mapping was available in 2 patients. RESULTS: Sustained AFL occurred in all patients with mean tachycardia cycle length (TCL) of 318 +/- 54 (276 - 420) ms. During tachycardia, fractionated or double potentials were recorded at either the septal CTI and/or the region of CS(OS) in all, and concealed entrainment with post-pacing interval (PPI)--TCL {\textless} or = 25 ms occurred in this area; but manifest entrainment with PPI {\textgreater} TCL was demonstrated from the anteroinferior CTI and other annular sites in 7/8 patients. In one, tachycardia continued with conduction block at the anteroinferior CTI during ablation. Up to three different right atrial activation patterns (identical TCL) were observed. The tachycardia showed a counterclockwise (CCW) pattern in 6, a clockwise pattern in 2, and simultaneous activation of both low lateral right atrium and septum in 5. Electroanatomic mapping was available in 2, showing an early area arising from the septal CTI in 1, and a CCW activation sequence along the TA in another. Radiofrequency application to the septal CTI terminated tachycardia in 4, and tachycardia no longer inducible in all. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a tachycardia circuit confined to the septal CTI/CS(OS) region, and hypothesize that this circuit involves slow conduction within the CTI and around the CS(OS), which acts as a central obstacle.},

abstract = {Objectives: We hypothesized that human atrial fibrillation (AF) may be sustained by localized sources (electrical rotors and focal impulses), whose elimination (focal impulse and rotor modulation [FIRM]) may improve outcome from AF ablation. Background: Catheter ablation for AF is a promising therapy, whose success is limited in part by uncertainty in the mechanisms that sustain AF. We developed a computational approach to map whether AF is sustained by several meandering waves (the prevailing hypothesis) or localized sources, then prospectively tested whether targeting patient-specific mechanisms revealed by mapping would improve AF ablation outcome. Methods: We recruited 92 subjects during 107 consecutive ablation procedures for paroxysmal or persistent (72{\%}) AF. Cases were prospectively treated, in a 2-arm 1:2 design, by ablation at sources (FIRM-guided) followed by conventional ablation (n = 36), or conventional ablation alone (n = 71; FIRM-blinded). Results: Localized rotors or focal impulses were detected in 98 (97{\%}) of 101 cases with sustained AF, each exhibiting 2.1 ?? 1.0 sources. The acute endpoint (AF termination or consistent slowing) was achieved in 86{\%} of FIRM-guided cases versus 20{\%} of FIRM-blinded cases (p {\textless} 0.001). FIRM ablation alone at the primary source terminated AF in a median 2.5 min (interquartile range: 1.0 to 3.1 min). Total ablation time did not differ between groups (57.8 ?? 22.8 min vs. 52.1 ?? 17.8 min, p = 0.16). During a median 273 days (interquartile range: 132 to 681 days) after a single procedure, FIRM-guided cases had higher freedom from AF (82.4{\%} vs. 44.9{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001) after a single procedure than FIRM-blinded cases with rigorous, often implanted, electrocardiography monitoring. Adverse events did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Localized electrical rotors and focal impulse sources are prevalent sustaining mechanisms for human AF. FIRM ablation at patient-specific sources acutely terminated or slowed AF, and improved outcome. These results offer a novel mechanistic framework and treatment paradigm for AF.

abstract = {There is much current interest in identifying the anatomical and functional circuits that are the basis of the brain's computations, with hope that functional neuroimaging techniques will allow the in vivo study of these neural processes through the statistical analysis of the time-series they produce. Ideally, the use of techniques such as multivariate autoregressive (MAR) modelling should allow the identification of effective connectivity by combining graphical modelling methods with the concept of Granger causality. Unfortunately, current time-series methods perform well only for the case that the length of the time-series Nt is much larger than p, the number of brain sites studied, which is exactly the reverse of the situation in neuroimaging for which relatively short time-series are measured over thousands of voxels. Methods are introduced for dealing with this situation by using sparse MAR models. These can be estimated in a two-stage process involving (i) penalized regression and (ii) pruning of unlikely connections by means of the local false discovery rate developed by Efron. Extensive simulations were performed with idealized cortical networks having small world topologies and stable dynamics. These show that the detection efficiency of connections of the proposed procedure is quite high. Application of the method to real data was illustrated by the identification of neural circuitry related to emotional processing as measured by BOLD.},

abstract = {Evaluation of brain connectivity in the frequency domain is based on prior multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model identification from multichannel neurological time series. The MVAR model commonly used in neuroscience applications accounts only for lagged effects among the time series and forsakes instantaneous effects. However, zero-lag interactions are likely to occur among simultaneously recorded neural signals, and the impact of their exclusion on connectivity measures has not been investigated yet. In this study we propose the use of an extended MVAR model including instantaneous effects, and compare its performance to that of the traditional MVAR approach using the Partial Directed Coherence (PDC). We show by simulations that, in presence of zero-lag correlations, the PDC derived from traditional MVAR modeling may produce misleading frequency domain connectivity evaluation, and that in such situations the correct connectivity pattern is recovered using the extended MVAR model. Then we provide examples of multichannel EEG recordings in which instantaneous effects are found to be far from negligible, and thus extended MVAR modeling seems more suitable to elucidate direction and strength of the interactions among EEG rhythms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying important biological processes, a detailed description of the gene products networks involved is required. In order to define and understand such molecular networks, some statistical methods are proposed in the literature to estimate gene regulatory networks from time-series microarray data. However, several problems still need to be overcome. Firstly, information flow need to be inferred, in addition to the correlation between genes. Secondly, we usually try to identify large networks from a large number of genes (parameters) originating from a smaller number of microarray experiments (samples). Due to this situation, which is rather frequent in Bioinformatics, it is difficult to perform statistical tests using methods that model large gene-gene networks. In addition, most of the models are based on dimension reduction using clustering techniques, therefore, the resulting network is not a gene-gene network but a module-module network. Here, we present the Sparse Vector Autoregressive model as a solution to these problems. RESULTS: We have applied the Sparse Vector Autoregressive model to estimate gene regulatory networks based on gene expression profiles obtained from time-series microarray experiments. Through extensive simulations, by applying the SVAR method to artificial regulatory networks, we show that SVAR can infer true positive edges even under conditions in which the number of samples is smaller than the number of genes. Moreover, it is possible to control for false positives, a significant advantage when compared to other methods described in the literature, which are based on ranks or score functions. By applying SVAR to actual HeLa cell cycle gene expression data, we were able to identify well known transcription factor targets. CONCLUSION: The proposed SVAR method is able to model gene regulatory networks in frequent situations in which the number of samples is lower than the number of genes, making it possible to naturally infer partial Granger causalities without any a priori information. In addition, we present a statistical test to control the false discovery rate, which was not previously possible using other gene regulatory network models.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The bidomain model of the heart leads to the result that the volume density of cardiac current source moment is proportional to the gradient of the macroscopic transmembrane action potential distribution. If the anisotropy ratios of the inner and outer domains (syncytia) of the myocardium are equal, then the volume distribution of cardiac sources can be replaced by an appropriate double layer on the heart surface. The double layer source distribution (heart surface source model) provides a basis for calculating heart surface potentials from cardiac sources. METHODS AND RESULTS: The heart surface model was used to calculate epicardial potentials for the normal heart as well as for a case of ischemia and of infarction. The model was also used to determine the effect of insulating the heart surface. Insulating the heart surface caused an almost fourfold increase in peak-to-peak amplitude of simulated electrograms, with little change in waveshape. Simulated electrograms showed good agreement with recorded electrograms reported in the literature. CONCLUSION: The heart surface source model appears to provide a basis for relating heart surface potentials to the distribution of cellular action potential.},

abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder in the Western world and a common cause of hospitalization and death. Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies have met with limited success, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms for AF. AF is traditionally characterized by spatiotemporally disorganized electrical activation and, although initiating triggers for AF are described, it is unclear whether AF is sustained by spatially meandering continuous excitation (re-entrant waves), localized electrical sources within the atria, or some other mechanism. This has limited therapeutic options for this condition. Here we show that human AF is predominantly caused by a small number (1.8 ± 0.9) of localized re-entrant waves or repetitive focal beats, that remain stable with limited spatial migration over prolonged periods of time. Radiofrequency ablation that selectively targeted the sites of these sources was able to immediately terminate fibrillation and eliminate the arrhythmia with high success. Our results show that human AF, despite apparent spatiotemporal disorganization, is often perpetuated by a few spatially-constrained and temporally conserved sources whose targeted ablation can eliminate this complex rhythm disorder.},
