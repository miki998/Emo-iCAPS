%% This function takes outputs from total activation, and adjusts the mask
% to remove NaN time courses. Those are due to voxels from the structural
% data that were not in the functional acquisition volume; a flat trace at
% zero leads to NaN outcomes out of the TA pipeline
%
% Inputs:
% - Data is a n_TP x n_ret_vox matrix of voxels
% - mask is the n_vox x 1 vector specifying what voxels have been inputs to
% the TA analysis
%
% Outputs:
% - Data2 is a n_TP x n_ret_vox_2 matrix with the NaN traces removed
% - mask2 is a new mask with the NaN time courses removed
