%% This function is the core script for total activation, calling the
% spatial and temporal subparts of the routine
%
% Inputs:
% TCN (n_time_points x n_ret_voxels) is the matrix of input data
% param is the structure containing relevant TA parameters; here, we
% require the fields 'Dimension' (4-element vector of X, Y, Z and T sizes),
% 'NbrVoxels' (number of voxels entering TA), 'GM_map' (3D volume
% containing the elements from the probabilistic gray matter map), 'sigma'
% (used in the computation of the spatial TA weights), 'NitTemp' (number of
% iterations to run the temporal scheme for), 'Nit' (number of iterations
% to run the forward-backward scheme for), 'weights' (weight given to
% temporal and spatial regularization schemes in the final averaging
% process)
%
% Outputs:
% - TC_OUT is a n_time_points x n_ret_voxels 2D matrix of data containing
% the output time courses from the total activation process
% Younes, Code optimization, Oct.2019
function [TC_OUT,param] = RunTotalActivation(TCN,param)

    % Spatial regularization is called (note that temporal regularization is
    % called from within MySpatial); TCN contains the time courses that we
    % measure (y), atlas contains the atlas map, param contains all parameters
    % for the algorithm (as well as the gray matter map)
    % Important: if using TV_PPM as a spatial method, 'atlas' is NOT USED
    % anywhere, although it is an argument of MySpatial
    
    TC_OUT = zeros(param.Dimension(4),param.NbrVoxels);

    % Initialization of temporal and spatial matrices (solutions to the
    % two regularization problems)
    xT = zeros(param.Dimension(4),param.NbrVoxels);
    xS = zeros(param.Dimension(4),param.NbrVoxels);

    k=1;
    stepsize=1;

    % The outputs of get_weight_gradient are 4D matrices (time is the
    % fourth dimension, volume the first three): large weights mean
    % that along the x, y or z direction, a given voxel has the same
    % tissue type as his neighbour

        % regularizer solution
        % Hence, at iteration k=1, we give our data (TCN) to My
        % Temporal. Then, we give (whole estimate - temporal estimate +
